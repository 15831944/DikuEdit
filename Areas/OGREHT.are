The Beginning of a Rocky Mountain Path&N~
&N   The mountains in this region are very rough and unforgiving to the many
unprepared travelers who wander this way.  The harsh realities of the mountain
regions has made this section of the world uninhabitable for almost every race
imaginable.  There is a large &+Chuman&N settlement located somewhere up in the
mountains here.  There is a &+ywooden sign&N that has been knocked down into the
&+Ldirt&N.  There is a narrow and rocky path that leads to the north.&N

A Turn on a Narrow Mountain Path&N~
&N   The narrow mountain path turns here in another direction.  The &+Lstone walls&N
naturally provided by the mountains prevent much of the &+Cchill winds&N from biting
into ones skin, but the temperature alone could &+Cfr&N&+cee&N&+Cze&N someone to death.  The
&+Lrocks &Nand &+Lstone&N of the mountains is grey in color, much like the atmosphere of
this remote place.  The path has been recently cleared of any rockfalls that
are quite frequent in these mountains.  There is no sign of life, however, as
all the &+yanimals&N seem to be hiding.  It seems queer that no one from the village
has come out to greet the incoming travelers.  The guards could obviously see
anyone coming from their high vantage point.  It does not matter though for
there are many miles still before one could reach the city gates.  One may go
south out of this place, or east, further into the mountains and towards the
mountain village.&N

A Turn on the Rocky Mountain Pass&N~
&N   The narrow mountain path continues to twist and turn through the treacherous
mountains.  The rocky faces of the moutain sides has many sharp and jagged
edges, entirely preventing any climbing by unwanted visitors.  The large path
is obviously a main road to a community of civilized creatures.  The cold rock
does not hint at what kind of creatures live up in the mountains, but it is
safe to say they have intelligence.  One can see some large towers on the many
assorted mountain plateaus, obviously &N&+Lwatch&N&+W-&N&+Ltowers&N.  One may travel west or
north on this mountain trail.&N

On a Rocky Path Through the Mountains~
&N   This narrow path continues to wind and twist through the rocky mountain
side.  The trail has kept climbing up and up the side of the mountain.  Often
the path has been so steep that one would have to backtrack to find a climbable
section.  Little grows at this high altitude besides some knotty old &+gtrees&N and
&+Lth&N&+gor&N&+Lny&N&+g bushes&N.  There are many large boulders on the nearby mountain side,
often taller than a&+C human&N being.  There are large deposits of slippery gravel
and rocky&+L soil&N near the trail, often times spilling onto the path.  One may
travel west or south.&N

On a Narrow Mountain Path&N~
&N   This narrow path continues over the rocky rubble of the mountainside.  The
path is little more than a narrow game trail winding amongst the boulders and
rocks.  There are some small diseased &+gbushes&N growing in the rocky soil, giving
a little bit of color to the drab surrounding areas.  The air is crisp and
cold, refreshing to those of the surface.  The wind is deadly this high up in
the mountains, cutting through clothes easily and without much regard to the
safety of the travelers.  There is evidence of a recent landslide just off the
path.  One may travel north or east.&N

At the Bottom of a Steep Incline&N~
&N   The path turns and climbs up the sharp face of a rocky hill here.  There
are many large boulders and rocks strewn about the rocky terrain.  The amount
of boulders here seems overly silly, as there is no possible way that this many
boulders could have naturally landed here.  The ground is about half&+L soil&N and
half crushed rock making the earth very hard to grow &+gplants&N in.  The harsh
conditions both protect and isolate the region from outside attacks.  It is
apprant that the path is well used but poorly maintained.  One may travel
south or up.&N

A Narrow Mountain Path&N~
&N   This narrow mountain path winds back and forth to make traveling up the
steep incline easier.  There are many large boulders and rocks strewn about the
face of the ridge.  There are just a handful of small &+gshrubs&N growing amongst
the &N&+Lr&N&+Wu&N&+Lb&N&+Wb&N&+Ll&N&+We&N, sticking out in a sharp contrast.  The mountains are traversable
here but they are impassible higher up.  This one of the highest elevated areas
that is inhabitated in the entire world.  If one turns to the south and looks
out across the surrounding areas, a great deal of land is visible.  Great &N&+ggreen&N
fields of &+ggrass&N and hills covered with large &N&+gtrees&N are nearby and the&N&+C o&N&+cc&N&+Ce&N&+ca&N&+Cn&N
is on the horizon.  One may travel up or down.&N

Before the Gates of the City of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N~
&N   The large iron gates of the city prevent any unwanted access to this remote
&+Bogre&N village.  The village was once inhabited by the &+Chumans&N who built it.  They
called it&+C Th&N&+Wor&N&+Lnt&N&+Who&N&+Lr&N but the&N&+B ogres&N have renamed it&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N, for the brutal&N&+B ogre&N
who led the successful raid.  The &N&+Ls&N&+Wt&N&+Lo&N&N&+Wn&N&+Le &Nwalls of the city are on two sides of
the path, one on the left and one on the right.  The huge iron gates have been
reinforced by the &+Bogre&N&+L ironsmiths&N because the old gates were badly damaged from
the brutal fight that ensued when the city fell.  There are small rooms to the
west and east where the guards take breaks or play cards.  The great tactical
advantage that this place gives is a clear view of the entire lowlands and of
course the higher ground.  The &+Bogres&N have firmly entrenched themselves in this
mountain village.&N

The Side Room of the Guards Station&N~
&N   This small side room is often used to store weapons for the guards of the
village.  One could often see a pile of boulders right next to a rack full of
daggers or other weapons for use by skilled weaponmasters.  The&+B ogre&N guards are
either very stupid and strong or very skilled and smaller than the rest of his
peers.  There is a place for every male &+Bogre&N in the villages army.  The&+B ogres
&Nare a savage and viscious race that would not stop fighting until they were
victorious.  The fight for the city they renamed &+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N was a brutal raid.
The guards of the city tried in vain to prevent the rading party from gaining
the inside of the village by preventing them from accessing the gate.  The
&+Chuman&N guards could not match the strength of the huge warriors.  Many &+Chumans
&Nwere killed in this small side room.  One may travel east.&N

The Guards Sleeping Quarters&N~
&N   The &+Chuman&N guards that once guarded the city gates used this place to rest
and sleep between shifts.  The &+Bogres&N of&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N, however, use the small room
to brutalize any travelers dull enough to try to gain access to the city when
they aren't wanted.  The room is small for an &+Bogre&N even after they removed all
the furniture.  There are pieces of mutton and other such meats discarded upon
the ground.  There is a small&+y wooden table&N located near the center of the room.
The gates of the city are located to the west.&N

Just Inside the &N&+LCity Gates&N and on the&N&+L M&N&+Rai&N&+Ln S&N&+Rtree&N&+Lt&N of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N~
&N   This mountain village was once populated by hundreds of peaceful and very
enlightened&N&+C humans&N.  They lived here in peace, trading with neighboring towns
and villages.  There were many schools of higher learning, places rich people
sent their children.  The village became quite wealthy and the standard of
living was rather high.  Then one day an&+B ogre &Nraiding party blasted down the
gates of the village and went about destroying the town and enslaving or eating
the &+Chuman &Npopulance.  The village gates are located to the south.  There is a
large watch tower located to the east, a great place to spot passing merchants.
They are made of &+Liron &Nand have been reinforced several times.  The main path
of the village of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N travels to the north and south.  On may travel east

The Wide Roadway Named &+LGatto&N Road&N~
&N   &+LGatto&N road was originally called, &N&+gThe Road of Evergreen&N.  The&+B ogres &Nwho
took part in destroying the mountain village boasted that this road was the
easiest place to kill&+C humans&N, so easy that any gatto could do it.  In the&N&+B ogre &N
tongue, gatto means moron.  The translation of the name of this road is "moron
road".  The road itself was once paved with &N&+Lco&N&+Wbb&N&+Lle&N&+Wst&N&+Lon&N&+Wes&N but after the &+Bogres
sacked the city, most of the stones were removed in an effort to acquire
enough building materials to build the larger dwellings for the &+Bogres&N.  There
are large houses left over from before the &+Bogres &Ncame here.  One may travel
north and south on&+L Gatto &Nroad, or west into a&+C human&N house.&N

In Front of a Home on &N&+LGatto&N Road&N~
&N   The sacking of this city was quick and brutal.  The &N&+Chumans &Nthat once were
the inhabitants of this mountain village have been either&N&+r sl&N&+Lau&N&+rgh&N&+Lte&N&+rre&N&+Ld&N or forced
into slavery.  The road,&N&+L Gatto&N Road, is the main thoroughfare through the city,
a wide and well traveled street.  There are many large&+y wooden&N building built
here, left over from the time the&+C humans&N lived here, but there are also some
newer buildings made of stone by the &+Bogres&N.  The &+Bogres &Nmake almost all of their
most important buildings out of &+Lstone&N, the reason is unknown but it has been
speculated by outsiders that they do it to feel more at home in "civilized"
surroundings such as villages or cities far away from their mountain caves
where they once lived.  One may enter a&+y wooden &Nhouse by traveling east or south
and north on &+LGatto &NRoad.&N

A Four Way Intersection at the Town Proper&N~
&N   This large square was once used by the&+C humans&N for their daily market needs.
Food and other goods were sold here by merchants who usually came from out of
town.  They would come here and stay for the week and go home on the weekend.
The square is rather large and was once well maintained by the citys workers,
but now its just a place for the&+B ogre &Nwomen to come and gossip.  The stone
fountain here was once cleaned daily but has no fell into disarray.  &+LGatto&N

&NOn the Wide Path That is the &N&+LGatto &NRoad&N~
&N   The wide road continues to travel to the north and south.  The &+LGatto&N Road
was a very important road for the&+C humans&N because of all the trading they did,
but it is little more than just another road to the &N&+Bogres&N.  The&N&+B ogres&N have no
real trade with outside communities, unless of course you count relieving the
poor merchants who come too near to the village of their&N&+L h&N&+reads&N and coin purses.
The &N&+Bogres &Ntake everything by force, which fits very well to their nature.
There are large&+y wooden&N buildings located on both sides of the road.  The
majority of the residences are located on this road or just off it.  One may
travel north or south on&N&+L Gatto &NRoad or west into a weapons shop.&N

of&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor &Nhere.  The inn looms high over the street, one of the higher
buildings this side of the world.  The two story building was once a grand and
expensive place to the &+Chumans &Nthat once lived here.  Now, however, its just a
place for&+B ogres &Nand their guests to sleep or visit the prostitutes.  The &+ggrass&N
outside the inn has been killed by the &+Lbodily wastes &Nthey have dumped out of
the upper story windows.  There is a great deal of other &+Ltrash &Nand &+Lru&N&+Wbbi&N&+Lsh&N on

On the Central Path of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N&+L&N,&N&+L Gatto&N Road&N~
&N   When the&+B ogres&N poured through the gates of the city that fateful night,
the frightened&+C humans&N stampeded north on this main road.  Several dozen people
were killed just in the general confusion, trampled under the bare feet of the
still sleepy citizens.  The&+B ogres&N quickly followed cutting great swath through
the &+Chumans&N.  The sound of crunching &+Wbones &Nand&+W skulls &Nwas loud and carried on
through the night.  The night of horror these &+Chumans &Nfelt will never be known
anywhere else in the world because no one escaped.  &+LGatto&N Road continues to the
north here.  It is not as damaged as it is further south due to the fact that
less fighting went on here.  This was primarily the area between the two areas
of fighting.  The&+C human &Nguards fought to hold the gate to the south and the
final fight happened in the north with the &+Chumans&N trying to fend off the
oncoming army of&+r blood&N&+W-&N&+rthirsty&N&+B ogres&N.  One may travel north or south.&N

&N   This wide intersection is where the main road of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N, the &+LGatto&N Road,
intersects with the &N&+LDark &N&+gThorn &N&+LRoad&N.  They meet here roughly the center of
the mountain village.  This used to be where the&+C humans&N held their "yearly
execution" of criminals.  There was once a large &+ygallow system&N here that could
hang up to ten criminals at once.  The entire square was more of a warning
than an actual device for getting rid of criminals.  The entire time the &+Chumans&N
lived here, not one person was executed.  There were two thieves who got a hand
cut off but that was the extent of the punishment given out.  The &+Bogres&N killed
a great deal of &+Chumans &Non these two roads, and they took great pleasure while
doing it.  The road travel in different directions.  One may travel east or

purchasing food for their families, acquiring household goods and slaves and
meeting with other &N&+Bogres&N for some labor.  The labor usually comprises of the
common search and destroy method used to rob merchants of their lives and of
their purses. &N&+L Gatto&N Road travels right in front of a merchants store which is
located to the west.  The building looks like it was once used by a poor&N&+C human
&Nfamily and has not been renovated too much ever since.  There are some plate
glass windows on this side of the building and one can see many different kinds
of goods being sold by the shopkeeper.  One may travel north or south on this

Inside One of the Many Sacked Homes of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N~
&N   This house was one of the first to be attacked and destroyed by the&+B ogre&N

hooks that pots and pants used to be hung from on the wall.  The large &+Liron&N

&+LP&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl &N&+LA&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rn&N&+Lu&N&+re&N~
&+L   This side street is often where the male&N &+Bogre &N&+Lchildren meet to wrestle or
&+Lpractice their fighting skills.  The &N&+Bogre&N&+L girls often come to watch the funny
&+Lspectacle, taking pleasure in the boys inability to be co-ordinated.  There
&+Lare many muddy tufts of&N&+g grass &N&+Lon the street that were either torn up from the
&+Lfighting or in a sod fight.  It is uncertain what the&N&+C humans &N&+Lused this street
&+Lfor, more than likely to trade goods or exchange ideas.  The &N&+Bogre&N&+L community
&+Ldoesn't waste their time with such nonsense.  The way of the &N&+Bogres &N&+Lis to kill
&+Land destroy, which makes this community even stranger.  They have killed all
&+Lthose who once lived here but they have also rebuilt the village and made it
&+Ltheir own.  They show an odd sense of reverance for something that is theirs,
&+Lbut at the same time, great irreverance for the property of others.  One may
&+Ltravel east or west on P&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl &N&+LA&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rn&N&+Lu&N&+re&N&+L.&N

&+LOn &+LP&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl&N &+LA&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rn&N&+Lu&N&+re&N~
&+L   P&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl&N&+L A&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rn&N&+Lu&N&+re&N&+L is not an overly important road for the &N&+Bogre &N&+Lvillage.  A few
&+Lhouses are located here but the majority of the population lives elsewhere.  A
&+Lfair amount of attention is given to the eastern part of the avenue because of
&+Lthe fact that the bank is located in this part of the village.  The avenue is
&+Llarge enough for two full grown &N&+Bogres&N&+L to walk side by side without any major
&+Lproblems save the occassional low awning.  Many&N &+ywooden &N&+Lbuildings are visible in
&+Lthe nearby area, their sides and back-yards visible from this point.  One may
&+Ltravel west or east from this point.&N

&+LBetween Some Buildings on &+LP&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl&N&+L A&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rn&N&+Lu&N&+re&N~
&+L   The road continues here traveling between the many homes and buildings of
&+Lthe mountain village.  The street is littered with many&N&+Y sun&N-&N&+Wbleachd bones&N &+Land
&+Lstrips of&N&+r flesh&N&+L, left behind by a well-fed &+Bogre&N&+L.  The buildings here block out
&+Lthe wind and, for a majority of the day, the sun.  There are homes on either
&+Lside of the street, once inhabited by&N&+C humans&N&+L, now inhabited by&N &+Bogres&N&+L and their
&+Lfamilies.  The house to the north appears to have been involved in a large fire
&+Lor something to that effect.  There is some small piles of &N&+ywood&N&+L piled up on the
&+Llawn, more than likely from some &N&+Bogre&N&+L children who were playing.  This place
&+Lsmells of a badly rotting corpse and the amount of flies here is staggering.

&+L   The large street ends here at the corner of the mountain village.  There
&+Lare a few small rocks and pebbles in the road, the final remnants of the large
&+Land well made cobblestone street that the &N&+Chumans&N&+L proudly made.  There is a
&+Llarge and important looking &N&+ywooden &N&+Lbuilding to the south, one of the few
&+Lstructures not destroyed for fun by the lead&N&+B ogre&N&+L war parties. There is a large
&+Lporch and a well maintained yard, quite odd for an &N&+Bogre&N&+L community.  The road
&+Lends here at a &N&+ywooden wall&N&+L erected to keep the wild animals away from the
&N&+Lhuman&N&+L children, now used to keep the&N&+C human&N&+L slaves in.  There is a tangled mess
&+Lof &N&+ythorny&N&+g bushes&N&+L to the north.  One may travel south into the bank or west on

&+LThe P&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl&N&+L A&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rv&N&+Lu&N&+re&N&+L Bank&N~
&+L   This bank is used by the&N&+B ogres &N&+Lto store any money they happen upon.  They
&+Lare never sure why exactly they save their money, but usually its to treat
&+Lthemselves with a nice new sword once in a while.  The bank is a converted
&+Lchapel used by one of the different religious sects the&N&+C humans&N&+L had before the
&N&+Bogre&N&+L raid.  There is a large&N&+y counter &N&+Lnear the back of the room where the many
&N&+Ltransactions take place.  The &N&+ytable &N&+Lwas originally used in sacrifical offerings
&+Lby the &N&+Chuman&N&+L cult.  There are no other tables or chairs in the entire building.
&+LOne can see where the pews were onced nailed to the floor by the large holes
&+Lthat are now there.  The pews were more than likely ripped out for use in the
&+Lconstruction of the larger buildings that &N&+Bogres&N&+L made.  There is no door on the
&+Lbank because that too was ripped off.  One may travel north.&N

&+LIn Front of a House on P&N&+rr&N&+Li&N&+rm&N&+La&N&+rl&N&+L A&N&+rv&N&+Le&N&+rn&N&+Lu&N&+re&N~
&+L   The wide avenue continues here through the mountain village.  &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N
&+Lwas once a very prosperous mountain town, trading with the surrounding towns
&+Land villages.  One fateful night a savage party of raiding &N&+Bogres&N&+L quickly over-
&+Ltook the guards of the village.  They brutally murdered or enslaved every
&+Lsingle &N&+Chuman&N&+L in the entire village.  There are many signs of the raid still
&+Lclearly visible on the surrounding buildings.  There are many former &N&+Chuman&N&+L
&+Lhomes nearby that still bear the scars of &N&+rf&N&+Li&N&+rre&N&+L.  Many of the houses have been
&+Lpummeled with rocks and large &N&+yclubs&N&+L so they lean at odd angles.  The most
&+Levident sign of the &N&+Bogre&N&+L raid, however, is the many dead bodies that still
&+Llitter the ground and floors of the buildings.  There is a house to the south
&+Lof here that one can explore.  The road continues to the east and west.&N

&+L   The town of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N&+L is a very strange place for outsiders.  In most modern
&+Lsocieties the dead are either buried or burned in large &N&+ypyres&N&+L but here in this
&+Lremote mountain village, the dead are left out in the street to be devoured by
&+Lwhatever creature happens to come upon the&N&+W corpse&N&+L.  The &N&+Bogres&N&+L often burn their
&+Ldead but they have left the slain&N&+C human &N&+Lbodies in the streets and in their
&+Lhomes.  The town smells of rot and decay, an all too unpleasant smell.  The
&+Lcold mountain air often rids the village of such smells, but on warm days it
&+Lsmells terrible.  There are many homes in this part of the village.  The road
&+Lis covered with small tufts of &N&+ggrass&N&+L and &N&+Gweeds&N&+L.  One may travel to the east or

&+Lwith surrounding communities.  Quite often merchants are slain as they pass
&+Lin the shadows of these mountains.  On this particular section of town many
&N&+Chumans&N&+L were slain.  A&N&+C human &N&+Wskull &N&+Llies here on the ground attracting both flies

Inside a Destoryed &N&+CHuman&N Home&N~
&N   This was once a paupers home, the poor &+Chuman&N male who never had any real
amount of money.  He built this home himself out of&+y logs&N he personally cut from
a nearby &+gforest&N.  The &+Bogres&N who sacked this home crushed the man under a big
&+Lrock&N.  They ate his skinny body in less than twenty minutes and quickly moved
on to look for another kill.  The house has been absolutely demolished.  The
&+ytables&N and&+y chairs&N that once were located here have been smashed and thrown
about to the point where they just look like individual pieces of &+ywood&N.  This
house is a deffinite &+rfire &Nhazard and will probably burn down before the&+y wood
&Ngets used for any practical purpose.  There is an upstairs loft that is still
stable enough to stand upon.  It can be reached by going up or go north back
into the street.&N

The shop is in the same blacksmith building that the &+Chumans&N used.  The only
difference is that this buildings roof has been&+L burnt &Noff.  The shop has many
&+ywooden racks &Nused to store weapons that are either for sale or awaiting further
alterations.  There is also a large grinding wheel that is used to further
sharpen the blades of the weapons.  The large work&+y table &Nis covered with many
&+Ci&N&+cr&N&+Co&N&+cn&N rods and solid blocks of&N&+C i&N&+cr&N&+Co&N&+cn&N, all of which are awaiting usage on a fine

&N   This large sitting room was used to attract visitors to the inn.  There
were once many plush sitting &+ycouches&N used by the patrons of the inn as they
waited for a room to open up.  There are still some broken &+Yla&N&+Wm&N&+Yps&N hanging from
the ceiling, more than likely smashed in some raucous fun by the&+B ogres&N.  The
&+ywooden floor &Nhas been allowed to become and stay&+L dirty&N over the many months
since the &+Bogre&N raid.  There was once a &+ylarge desk&N used by the clerk to check
in the guests &+yluggage&N or valuables.  The &+ycounter &Nhas been smashed down and
kicked apart, now lying in pieces in the corner.  There were once two large
plate-glass windows that overlooked the street outside, but they too have been
smashed.  The large &+yoak door&N to the west is still amazingly upon its hinges.
One may take the &+ywooden stairs&N up to the nest level of the inn.  One may travel

&NA Small Side Room Used to Feed the Troops&N~
&N   This large room is used to feed the hungry guards and raiding parties that
are put into use every day.  The large room was once used as a dining room by
a rich business man to entertain his guests.  There are many large &+ywooden
&+ytables&N and &+ychairs&N scattered about the floor, no real order to them.  There are
some small &+ycarts&N with wheels on them, used by the&+B ogre&N serving wenches to
bring the food into the room.  There are few scraps on the &+yfloor&N because of
the many&+y r&N&+La&N&+yt&N&+Ls&N who hide beneath the feet of the &+Bogres &Nas they eat.  One may

women aren't exactly graceful dancers so that particular tradition died when
the&+C humans&N did.  The small back room is now used to store large&+y barrels&N of
&+Bwater&N, stored just in case of a drought.  The room itself has a high ceiling
with some lanterns hanging from it which &+Willuminate &Nthe room.  There are some
small&+y tables &Nand &+ychairs&N around the floor, once used by the &+Chumans&N, but are now
too small to be used by the large &+Bogre&N adults.  The &+ytables &Nare often used by

levels of the inn.  There is a large and rather clean room here, used by the
&N&+Chumans &Nto hold large and grandly decorated dances.  The &N&+Bogres &Nonly dance on
the graves of their enemies so this room is obviously not used very much.  The
&N&+ywooden boards &Nthat make up the floor have warped somewhat, adding to the look
of neglect.  There was once a large&N&+Y c&N&+Wh&N&+Ya&N&+Wn&N&+Yd&N&+We&N&+Yl&N&+Wi&N&+Ye&N&+Wr&N hanging from the ceiling, but
that, much like the &+Chumans&N that once lived here, has been pulled down and
stomped flat.  There are several rooms on the top floor of the inn, many of
which are locked shut.  There are rooms to the north and south that remain
unlocked that one may visit.  To the east is the inn itself, a place where one
may obtain a key to a room.  There is a large and winding set of stairs leading
downward to the lower level of the inn.  One may travel north, south, east or

&NA Large Room Once Used To Entertain The Inns' Guests&N~
&N   This large room was essentially a meeting room for important guests and
their clients.  It was usually used as a place for merchants to meet important
suppliers to try to secure their accounts.  The room is very comfortable and
homey feeling.  There is a large&+L h&N&+We&N&+La&N&+Wr&N&+Lt&N&+Wh&N in the western wall that is almost
constantly well stocked with&+y wood&N.  The heat given off is almost enough to heat
the entire top level of the inn, but there is usually windows open to assure
the utmost comfort.  The &+Bogres&N use this room in much the same manner except
for the fact they are not doing any business.  The &+Bogre&N women usually meet here
to gossip about other women, a trait common to almost every race in Basternae.
There is a small coffee&+y table&N that is covered with salted meat for the women
to snack on.  One may travel south in the inn.&N

The Inn of the City of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N~
&N   The inn of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N is a rowdy and disorderly place.  The place closely
resembles a boisterous pub or a raucous tavern.  Many&+y tables &Nand&+y chairs&N are
thrown about the room during the &+rsa&N&+Lva&N&+rge&N fights that occur here nightly.  The
innkeeper rents out rooms here for almost nothing.  This inn is often a place
to garner to information about future raiding parties or quests for adventure.
The innkeeper can be found here, handing out keys to any who wishes to spend
the night here.  The entire room reaks of&+Y urine&N and congealed &+rblood&N.  Huge
&+Lblack flies &Ncloud the air, looking for scraps of food to devour.  Many &+Bogres&N
have died in this very spot.  On the other hand, hundreds of&+C humans&N were
hearded into this room to be tortured and killed.  One may travel west.

with the successful raid.  Those women were later killed and have been long
forgotten.  This room is now the home to another group of prostitutes, this
group made up of&N&+B ogres&N.  The scent of&N&+M perfume&N is heavy in the air, almost to
where it stings an individuals eyes.  There is a large rug on the floor that

A Small House&N~
&N   This small house is unremarkable and was probably used by a common worker
and his family.  The&+y wooden floor&N is full of smally cut marks which are filled
with dirt and dust.  The scratches were probably made before the time of the
&+Bogre&N raid because it appears that this house was not damaged badly, if at all,
in the fighting.  All the furniture remains relatively intact as only time has
damaged it.  This house remains empty for reasons unknown.  Perhaps it is just

&+LOn Dark &N&+gThorn&N&+L Road&N~
&+L   This street travels east and west through&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N&+L.  The road itself is
&+Lnot well maintained by the &N&+Bogres &N&+Lof the village.  It was, however, maintained
&+Lwith great pride by the humans when they were in control of the remote mountain
&+Lcommunity.  There are many homes on this side street, often small and only one
&+Lrooms.  The &N&+Glawns&N&+L were small and often not maintained because the inhabitants
&+Ljust didn't care.  There are many &N&+gthorny bushes&N&+L growing in those same unkept
&+L&N&+glawns&N&+L.  To the south there is a rundown old house.  It's hard to tell if anyone
&+Llives in there from the look of it.  One may travel east or west on Dark &N&+gThorn&N
&+LRoad.&N

&N&+LAmongst the Many Houses of Dark &N&+gThorn&N&+L Road&N~
&+L   Many small homes are located upon this street.  The street is made up of
&+Lmostly dirt and fine sand with very few&N&+g weeds &N&+Lgrowing on it.  There are many
&+Lsigns of a great fire on the&N&+y wooden&N&+L faces of the buildings, a solemn reminder
&+Lof that brutal raid.  These things are those that bring the &N&+Bogre &N&+Lpeople great
&+Lpride, yet remind the &N&+Chuman &N&+Lslaves of what happened to their town. &N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N
&+Lis a powerful center for the entire &N&+Bogre &N&+Lrace, a place to prosper and pray upon
&+Lpassing merchants.  To the &N&+Chuman &N&+Lrace, this mountain village is a sad reminder
&+Lof what happens when they are not prepared.  It is easy to see the gravity of
&+Lthe situation on the faces of the slaves, they know that their death is on the
&+Lway.  This road is one of the primary roads in the village, used for traveling
&+Lbetween a majority of the homes.  One may travel east or west on Dark &N&+gThorn&N
&+LRoad or south into a former &N&+Chuman &N&+Lhome.&N

&N&+LOn the Side Street, Dark &N&+gThorn&N&+L Road&N~
&+L   The wide street continues here through the mountain village of the&N&+B ogres&N&+L,
&N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N&+L.  Many houses are located on this street, inhabited by&N&+B ogre&N&+L families
&+Lor abandonned since the time the &N&+Chumans&N&+L lived here.  The road is entirely
&+Lcovered with some thick&N&+g grass&N&+L, often hiding what lies beneath it.  There are
&+Lsome trails that have stamped the &N&+ggrass&N&+L flat, used as the&N&+B ogre &N&+Lchildren play
&+Land run after one another.  There are some out of control &N&+gbushes&N&+L growing on
&+Lboth sides of the road on the &N&+ggreen lawns &N&+Lof the former&N&+C human&N&+L homes. To
&+Lthe north is a large tent made from what appears to be &N&+ydeer hide&N&+L.  The tent is
&+Llarge and appears to be well taken care of.  One may travel east or west on
&+Lthe road, north into the tent, or south into a home.&N

A Turn on the Wide Street of &+LGatto&N~
&N   &N&+LGatto Street &Nturns here as it weaves through the town.  The turn is due to
a large rock formation to the north that forces the road to turn around it.
The rock formation is covered with a great deal of crude phrases and other
forms of &N&+Lgr&N&+Wap&N&+Lhiti&N.  The road is covered with some cobblestones that appear have
not been well tended to, sticking out at odd angles.  There is a medium size

&+yBehind the Fence and On a Narrow &N&+LDirt Path&N~
&N   This narrow dirt path is located within the heart of the overgrown park.
The many thorned &+gtrees&N and &+gbushes&N reach into the once wide path, often causing
wicked scratch marks and gouges.  The path may have been once paved with small
cement blocks but it is no longer visibile amongst the&+L dirt&N and &+Lmud&N.  The path
is little more than a game trail now heading off to the east through the
tangled mess of &+ybranches&N.  There is a large &N&+ywooden fence &Nlocated to the south,
once used to keep out the wild animals, now it keeps them in.  One may travel

&N   This dirt path winds back and forth behind the&+y wooden &Nbuildings of the
village.  There are many small&+g bushes&N and&+g trees &Nlocated to the north, not
hampering travel too much.  This back path seems to be both a secret and a
favorite hiding place for the young&+B ogre&N boys.  One can clearly see many small
&+Wbones &Nleft over from hares the boys have clubbed to death.  Few of the older
&+Bogres&N come back here because it is regarded as "geehash" or childsplay and a
place adults wouldn't need bother with.  The path is slightly &+Lmuddy&N from a
recent rain and the place smells oddly fresh.  One may travel east or west.&N

&NTraveling Away From &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N~
&N   This small&+L dirt path&N has led away from the &+Bogre&N hometown.  From this far
away from &+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N one can see the destruction laid upon the city somewhat.
There are many burnt and partially destroyed &+Lroof&N&+W-&N&+ytops&N visible just above the
&+gtree&N line.  There are many sounds of &+Bogres&N yelling and shouting back and forth,
obviously over something they both wanted.  There are many skinny tendrils of
&+Lsmoke &Nrising up over the town into the cold moutain air.  They twist and weave
like dancing &+Lsn&N&+Gakes&N in the sky, reaching out towards heaven.  To the east lies
the narrow &+Ldirt path&N that heads further up into the mountains.  A small &+gforest&N
is visible in that direction, some distance above this level.  One may travel

&NA Turn on the &+LDirt &NTrail&N~
&N   This&+L dirt trail &Nis now littered with an increasing number of large rocks
and boulders.  The large obstacles make it harder to travel swiftly or safely.
The rocks have all tumbled down from the rocky mountain cliffs to the north and
east.  The path has been rather straight to the west but it bends here and
travels south.  Some sparse &+gvegetation &Ngrows here in the unfertile &+Lsoil&N.  The
&+Lsoil&N here has far too much gravel and sand for most large &+gplants&N to grow.  The
many smaller scrub &+gtrees &Nand &+gbushes&N can grow here if they are far enough apart.
When the&+W snow&N falls this area is an eerie landscape, the &+Wsnow&N on rocks looking
very alien and out of place.  One may travel west or south from this point.&N

&N&NA Turn on the Small Stone Path&N~
&N   The trail turns here through the various rocks and boulders that have come
to rest on the mountainside.  There are many scraggly &+ggrasses &Ngrowing in the
little &+Lsoil&N their &+Wroots &Ncan find.  There is a great deal of a&N&+r rud&N&+Ld&N&+ry&N colored
soil covering the majority of the path, perhaps a ceremonial marker for the
trail.  The &+Bogres&N rarely come out of the comfort of the village to this part
of the mountain range because there is no real reason.  When the&+B ogres &Ndo leave
the village its to raid or kill and that is to the south.  The surrounding
areas in the mountains have not even been looked at by the&+B ogres&N who find no
value in these areas.  The mountain range rises to the east, looming like the
titans who once roamed the planet.  The trail continues to the east and west
through the mountainside.&N

&NBelow a Steep Mountain Ridge&N~
&N   This small &+Ldirt trail&N has gradually turned into a small rocky trail as it
winds up the side of the mountain.  The&+C humans &Nrarely traveled back this way by
all appearances, the path showing no signs of ware.  Small&+g plants&N and scrub
&+ggrasses&N grow in the rocky &+Lsoil&N, somehow finding a way to live where nothing
rightly should.  Many wild creatures live here behind &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N, but they are
no more violent or deadly as the&N &+Bogres &Nwho live within the mountain village.
This trail is quite puzzling as it serves no obvious purpose as it winds about
the mountainside.  One may travel west or upward from this point.&N

&NOn a Small Mountain Ridge&N~
&N   This small mountain ridge runs almost parallel to the sheer mountain face.
There is a narrow trail that travels roughly on the very top of the ridge,
staying almost perfectly north.  Few&+g plants&N grow at this altitude, but those
which do are very hearty and can withstand the harsh conditions.  Small rocks
litter the side of the ridge and the side of the mountain, both adding to the
hazard of traveling here.  One can see much from this point, a great deal of
the town is visible from this higher vantage point. A great deal of&N&+C m&N&+Wist&N covers
this part of the mountain range in the early morning.  One may travel down the
perilous slope or north on the ridge.  A narrow valley appears to open to the
north between the two rock faces.&N

In a Very Narrow Valley in the Mountains&N~
&N   The path continues to wind through the rocky areas of the mountain side.
There rock walls rise very high at this point completely surrounding this path.
They rise high up on both sides completely preventing any travel that deviates
from direction of the path.  The path is entirely made of stone at this point,
no&N&+g plants&N grow here to allow&N&+L soil&N to buildup.  The wind is almost entirely dead
in this rocky valley, prevented access to this path by the towering rocky
walls.  This area smells rather stagnant and stale as there is no way for it
to be aired out.  One may travel south or east from this point on the narrow
rock path.&N

the mountainside.  There is some&N&+L dirt &Nand &N&+ggrass&N growing here, a nice break from
the boring and disheartening rocky paths to the south and west.  Few travelers
come up to this part of the mountain.  The &N&+Bogres&N tend to steer towards the many
passing merchants in the foothills and the &N&+Chumans&N tended to keep to themselves.
This part of the world is seldom seen by any race save the animals.  One may

&+gdehydrated.  The green leaves grow sparsely on the &N&+ybrown&N&+g branches, providing
&+gjust enough to keep the tree alive.  Some scraggely grass grows in the soil
&+gleft behing by the decomposed leaves.  There are some low lying bushes growing
&+gamongst the roots of the larger trees.  There are many&N&+L r&N&+Wo&N&+Lc&N&+Wk&N&+Ls&N&+g sticking up out
&+gof the &N&+Lsoil&N&+g, looking very much like uneven teeth sticking out of the earth.

&+gInside the Forest&N~
&+g   The odd forest continues to sprawl out on the narrow plateau in the wild
&+gmountainside.  The mere fact that this forest exists is a little unnerving,
&+gseeming very unnatural and out of place.  Perhaps this forest was created by
&+gthe powerful magics of the shamans who came with the tribe, but that makes
&+glittle sense.  The&N&+B ogre&N&+g people have no appreciation for beauty or nature.  The
&+gshamans themselves manipulate nature to help them bring war upon the world.
&+gThere is no reverance in their hearts.  Perhaps the&N&+C humans&N&+g had a powerful druid
&+gwho created this forest, a place where he or she could come and meditate.
&+gEither way, this forest is filled with many animals and trees, which grow in
&+gthe rocky&N&+L soil&N&+g.  One may travel east, west or north from this point in the
&+gforest.&N

&+gIn the Small &N&+yMountain&N&+g Forest&N~
&+g   This small mountain forest is perched on a narrow outcropping of the
&+gmountains.  The entire forest is probably no more than a few dozen yards wide,
&+gbut it is very long and stretches around the side of the mountain.  There are
&+gfew varieties of trees, but the ones that do grow seem to be healthy enough.
&+gEither these trees were planted here by someone or a seed was dropped here by
&+gpure chance by a bird or animal.  Little grass grows here to keep the &N&+Lsoil&N&+g from
&+geroding, but the many small bushes and trees keep the &N&+Lsoil &N&+gin place in a manner
&+gthat prevents the precious &N&+Ldirt&N&+g from washing away during the spring melt or
&+gthe summer rains.  One may travel north, south or east in this forest.&N

&+gthat one cannot even see mountain village of the&N&+B ogres&N&+g.  Many animals have
&+glived their entire lives in this small copse of trees, often never venturing
&+gbeyond the green borders of the treeline.  The thick&N&+y bark&N&+g of the trees provides
&+ga good deal of protection from both the animals and the environment.  The
&N&+ybrown &N&+gcolor of the trees sticks out sharpy in contrast to the deep green color
&N&+gof the leaves.  One may travel west, east or south from this point.&N

&+gtrees, in fact, grow at wierd angles until they reach around the hard rocks.

&+gcan easily be heard chirping in the thick tree limbs above.  To the south one

&N&+gNear a Cliff in the &N&+yMountain&N&+g Forest&N~
&+g   The forest thins out here at the edge of a great mountain cliff.  Over the
&+Lrocky edge&N&+g one can see the entire layout of the mountain village of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N.
&+gThe&N&+C human&N&+g village was once a peaceful and prosperous community, living and
&+gtrading with its neighbors.  Many generations had grown up happy and secure.
&+gThe &+Bogres &N&+gwho now inhabit the town have destroyed that peaceful serenity and
&+gcreated their own community.  The&+B ogres&N &+ghave retained some sense of unity as
&+gthe tribe they once were, yet many divisions have been formed amongst the
&+gvarious small groups.
&+g   The mountains that surround the village are cold and hard, much like the
&+Bogres &N&+gthemselves.  The&N &+Wsnow capped peaks &N&+gto the north supply much of the known
&+grealms water supply.  It is said that during the formation of the world the
&+ggods that lived in the underdark pushed the mountains up in an effort to get
&+gthemselves more space.  They loom now over the entire area, a testament to the
&+gpower of nature.  One may travel east back into the&+g forest&N.&N

&+gforest, like a small shelf on the rocky southern face.  The trees that grow in
&+gthis part of the forest are smaller because they have to grow in a smaller area
&+gof&N&+L soil&N&+g.  The rocky &N&+Lsoil&N&+g appears to be very infertile, but the plants that do
&+ggrow here look healthy enough.  There are many large rocks sticking up out of
&+gthe &N&+Lsoil&N&+g, looking like the skulls of giant earth elementals.  The smells here
&+gare deffinetly that of a typical forest, both sweet and musky.  One may travel

&+gAlong the High Stone Wall of the Mountain&N~

&+gThe steep mountain wall to the east prevents any plants from gaining a good
&+ghold and growing.  There are many small rocks and pebbles near the base of the
&+gwall, which fell down in the harsh&N&+W winter&N&+g storms or in the rain.  Small bushes
&+ggrow around the bases of the trees, but they are a ugly yet resilient breed.
&+gThe trees provide a great deal of shade in this part of the forest, but the
&+grocky mountain face gets very hot in the mid-day sun.  One may travel west or

&+gquite remarkable.  Here, peace rules, not the fist.  The trees grow tall and
&+gproud in the almost infertile and rocky soil.  Animals live in peace and grow
&+gto be strong and content.  Many small bushes grow here, making traveling a
&+glittle bit difficult, but there are many small paths made by the animal
&+ginhabitants.  One may travel west, north or south from this point.&N

&+gA Dead End in the &N&+yMountain &N&+gForest&N~
&+g   The mountain forest ends here as it comes into the rocky grasp of the
&+gsurrounding mountains.  The mountain walls are sheer and without any holds for
&+gthe forest to start their roots upon.  The rocks look very bare and alone in
&+gcomparisson to the lush green forest to the north.  This small depression in
&+gthe side of the mountain makes this part of the forest both a death trap and
&+ga good hiding place, depending upon ones situation.  The &N&+ybrown trunks &N&+gof the
&+gsurrounding trees are intersected by various&N&+y branches&N&+g and underbrush that seems
&+gto grow everywhere.  One may travel north in this mountain forest.&N

&N&+LIn Front of a Demolished House on Dark &N&+gThorn&N&+L Road&N~
&N&+L   Dark &N&+gThorn&N &N&+LRoad continues to travel east and west from this point.  The
&N&+Lstreet has been allowed to grow up with various&N&+g plants&N&+L and &N&+ggrasses&N&+L covering the
&+Lonce well maintained roadway.  There are many houses along this home, some
&+Linhabited, some deserted.  There are many &N&+ywooden&N&+L objects that lie half buried
&+Lin the tall grasses of the lawns.  One can see many&N&+y wooden &N&+Lswings, well houses,
&+Lpicnic tables and even a planter every once in a while.  These things are a
&+Lsolemn reminder to the &N&+Chuman&N&+L slaves of what they once had.  These ghosts of
&+Lthe past slowly fade into the grass much like the&N&+C humans &N&+Lthat once lived here
&+Lin&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N&+L.  To the&N&+B ogres&N&+L, they are wood and nothing more.  There is a dead
&+Lcat that has been smashed into the ground in the middle of the street.  There
&+Lis a home to the south and one may travel east or west on the street.&N

&NIn a &+gMoss &NCovered Family Room&N~
&N   This was once the family room of a&+C human &Nhome.  In fact, this room was the
entire house as it was a very poor family.  The one room held the entire family
comfortably as bunk beds were used on the southern wall to save space.  The
entire building is now covered with a thick layer of&+g moss &Nand &+Lpeat&N.  The fact
that the building was open to the elements helped to accelerate the general
&+Ldecay &Nof this building.  Even the tables and chairs are covered with the&+g moss&N,
adding to the look of hopelessness of this mountain village.  There are some

ever since.  The&+C human&N once had a large cabinet full of liquor and ale but it
has been significantly reduced by the heavy drinking done here.  There is not
much furniture remaining save one &+ytable &Nand two &+ychairs&N, just enough for the

&NInside a Demolished Former &N&+CHuman&N House&N~
&N   This was yet another human house the&+B ogres &Ndecided to demolish.  Although
the occupants had long been dead, the&+B ogre&N warriors decided that this place
needed to have a custom remodeling.  They tore the place up, damaging the place
so badly that it can no longer be inhabited.  The western &+ywall&N has been kicked
so hard that the entire building now shifts in that direction.  There are many
&+yboards&N scattered around the room, more than likely from shattered &+yfurniture&N and
floor&+y boards&N.  The only part of this house that was not damaged was the cellar
and that was only because the &+Bogres &Ndidn't know it was there.  There are some
&+yfloor boards &Nbroken in half and sticking up, making the floor very unstable.

In Front of the Former &N&+CHuman&N School&N~
&N   &N&+LGatto&N Road continues its generally north and south path here as it passes
a former &N&+Chuman&N school.  The school building it one of the larger structures in
&N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N and was once a point of pride for the &N&+Chuman&N inhabitants of this small
mountain village.  The school was once a place for&N&+C humans&N to learn and to grow
intellectually.  Now, however, the school is used for another, more sadistic
purpose.  On the outside of the school a large&N&+y wooden sign&N has been nailed to
the outer wall.  There are&N&+c iron&N&+L bars &Non all of the windows, one of the new
additions to the school done by the&N&+B ogres &Nthemselves.  There is a large door
that appears to be reinforced with &N&+Lst&N&+ce&N&+Lel&N.  One may travel north or south on

Inside the Destroyed &+CHuman&N School&N~
&N   This entrance to the former &+Chuman &Nschool once was used to store the many
coats and lunch pails of the children who attended here.  When the &+Wsnows &Ncame
they would stomp their feet to get all of the snow off before taking their
seats within the classroom.  The school is now used to store&+C human&N prisoners
before they are cut up and sold for meat by the brutal town &N&+rbu&N&+Ltch&N&+rer&N.  There are
many signs of struggle here on the floor, long and &+rbloody &Ngoughes in the floor,
left by the&N&+C humans&N fingernails as they were drug out.  Small pieces of scalp
and hair are also easiliy visible.  There is a large &+ywooden door&N to the east
that is locked in several places from the outside, ensuring that these &+Chumans&N
could never dare to escape.  One may travel north, west, south or east from
this point in the&+C human&N school.&N

Several &+ywooden pegs&N have been embedded into the wall for that purpose.  The
&+ywooden floor&N was once highly polished and swept daily.  Now it is covered with
both bodily remains and splattered&N&+r blood&N from the &N&+Chuman &Nprisoners that are held
here.  The windows on the eastern and northern walls have been broken out, some
of the glass inside the school.  The paint on the walls has faded and chipped
a great deal, adding to the general look of dissaray of this place.  One may

&NA Corner of the &N&+CHuman&N Holding Pens&N~
&N   This school has been turned into a make-shift holding pen for the &+Chuman&N
captives.  Eventually, when the &+Chuman&N population is either eaten or killed off,
this building will probably be inhabited by a large &+Bogre&N family or reallocated
for some other purpose.  The &+ywooden floor&N is splattered with &+rblood&N, obviously
&+Chuman&N.  There are some windows on the southern wall but they have been&+y boarded&N
shut by the&+B ogre &Nwarriors.  The ceiling is cracked and more than likely will
fall in if not repaired.  The &+Chumans &Nthat are restrained here are forced to
&N&+Ldef&N&+yic&N&+Late&N and &+Yurinate&N upon the floor for there are no bathroom facilities.  One

&Nstill were in control of this mountain town.  That teacher was more than likely
killed long ago, raped and beaten to death.  The &+ydesk&N has long ago been used in
a fire, burnt up to heat the cold hands of the&+B ogre &Nchildren during the harsh
winters.  The school is used now to house &+Chuman &Nprisoners, both from before the
time of the raid and the occassional captured merchant.  The entire building
reaks of &N&+Ld&N&+We&N&+La&N&+rt&N&+Lh&N and of unimaginable&+L filth&N.  One can feel the presence of death
that envelops this place.  One may travel east, north or south from this point

stained from the sheer volume of&+L filth&N that has been spread over them.  The

&NThe Final Holding Pens of The &N&+BOgre&N Food&N~
&N   This final holding pen of the&+C humans&N that are to used as food looks very
broken down and abused.  It is safe to say that the&+C humans &Nwho live there last
hours in this place know and dread their fate. &+B Ogres&N do not show the kind of
humanity most other races do, they skin their food alive, often enjoying the
look of utter horror on the faces of their prey.  This room has a sturdy&N&+y wooden
floor&N, but the walls and ceiling look as if they could fall down at any moment.
Few of the&+B ogre&N tribe actually come into this former school, the &N&+rbu&N&+Ltch&N&+rer&N being
the only one who really uses this building.  The windows are barred with heavy
metal&+L bars&N to prevent anyone from trying to break free.  One may travel east or

&N   This butcher shop is used by the&+B ogre &N&+rbu&N&+Ltch&N&+rer&N to fully meet his villages
meat needs.  He works up to twelve hours a day to process all the meat that is
needed.  Not that he needs it, he loves his work.  The entire shop is kept
clean and sanitary and there is no meat that is wasted.  There are some large
hooks that hang from the ceiling where the&N&+r ca&N&+Lrcasses &Nof cattle, goats and
&+Chumans&N are hung before skun and then cut up for individual use.  There is a
large counter that is used for the various jobs the &N&+rbu&N&+Ltch&N&+rer &Nneeds it for.
There is a door in the back of the shop that leads to a large room that was
once the school and is now a holding area for&+C humans&N before their slaughter
and subsequent consumption.  One may travel east or west from this&N&+r bu&N&+Ltch&N&+rer&N

The Intersection of &N&+LGatto&N Road and &N&+LThe Path of the Shaman&N~
&N   At this point in the mountain village of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N the&+L Gatto &NRoad intersects
with the very important&+L Path of the Shaman&N.   This particular intersection was
not here during the times the&+C humans &Ninhabited this place.  The shaman caves
were created by the&+B ogre&N shamans after the raid was completed and the road that
travels west from here was created soon after.  There are some buildings here
as well that house&+B ogre&N families and also some destroyed ruins of buildings.
The buildings were destroyed in the brutal raid that first brought the &+Bogres&N
here.  This road is often maintained by the&N&+C human&N slaves, supervised by the
&+Lslave&N&+W-&N&+Lmasters&N.  One may travel in any direction from this intersection.&N

&+LThe Path of the Shaman&N~
&+L   This path is very faint in the scruffy mountain grass that grows here.
&+LThis small street was not here when the &N&+Chumans&N&+L held this mountain village.  In
&+Lfact, the path was created right after the raid when the shamans of the ogre
&+Ltribe found a place to practice and teach their magical art.  The path should
&+Llook a lot older and wider than it appears to be, but a simple magical spell
&+Lhas been cast on it to prevent it from looking well used.  There are some odd
&+Llooking stones on the northern side of the path, used as a sign to help shamans
&+Lof other tribes find the underground chamber of the&N&+B ogres&N&+L.  One may travel west
&+Lor east from this point on the Path of the Shaman.&N

&+LAlong the Path of the Shaman&N~
&+L   This dark path seems to be shrouded in a kind of perpetual darkness.  The
&+Lair is thick and humid on even the coldest winter nights, and there is often a
&+Lthick layer of fog resting on the moist soil.  Small and strange looking plants
&+Lare growing on either side of the path.  These small plants appear to be alive
&+Leven though they do not move.  The plants are rumored to be carnivorous and
&+Lhave been enchanted with a magical spell to attack and eat any creature with
&+La goodly aura.  There are some small rocks and pebbles placed in what seems to
&+Lbe a random order, but to any of the&N&+B ogre&N&+L shamans, the placement of the stones
&+Lis significant and contains great power.  One may travel east or west from this
&+Lpoint on the path.&N

&+LOn the Path of the Shaman Before the Mouth of the Shaman Cave&N~
&+L   The path of the shamans ends here in front of the mouth to a cave.  The
&+Lcave is used by the shamans but for what purpose is unknown to most people,
&N&+Bogres &+Lof the tribe included.  The cave mouth is located in seemingly a random
&+Lplace, right in the middle of the ground.  The fact that this cave seems to
&+Lappear to be out of place tends to lead to the opinion that it is not naturally
&+Lformed.  The shamans probably crafted the cave into the stone of the mountain
&+Lso they would have a secluded place to practive their craft.  The dirt path
&+Lcontinues on to the east and the cave leads downwards.&N

&+LInside the Shaman Cave&N~
&+L   The first step into the shaman cave is filled with a swirling cloud of
&+Lcolors and smells.  These sensations are only in ones head, and are used to
&+Ldisorient anyone who should not be here.  The cave is highly defendable, but
&+Lnot by sheer man power.  The power of the shamans is in their link to the
&+Lnatural power of the planet.  There are enough wards in this cave to bring
&+Lthe entire place down if need be.  The cave here is empty and very clean,
&+Llooking both natural and serene.  Quite the opposite is the actual truth.  The
&+Lshamans are brutal and unrelenting in their pursuits for more power.  This
&+Lcave is dangerous.  One may travel up or east from this point.&N

&+LApproaching the Shaman Training Cave&N~
&+L   This cave looks so natural that it could only be unnatural.  The cave walls
&+Lhave a look that could only be something produced.  The rocky surface is uneven
&+Land jagged in places, looking both natural and alive.  The feeling of this cave
&+Lis one of power and of an eerie magical presence.  The air is thick and dank,
&+Llike the air of a deep and stagnant pool.  The floor of the cave is relatively
&+Lclear of any debris and appears to be either abandonned or well maintained,
&+Lyet another way that this cave seems out of place.  There are some odd sounds
&+Lcoming from further in the cave, sounding both like a chant and a tribal dance.
&+LOne may travel west or down from this point in the shaman cave.&N

&+Lseveral side caves that lead from this point and even a set of stone stairs
&+Lleading down to a lower level.  This cave is not naturally formed as the walls
&+Lare smooth and glassy to the touch.  The shamans have practiced here ever
&+Lsince the successful &N&+Bogre&N&+L raid that captured this city.  One may trave east,
&+Lwest, south or down from this point.  Going up another flight of stone steps
&+Lleads out of the shaman caves.&N

&N   Great&N&+y to&N&+rr&N&+ych&N&+re&N&+ys&N burn on both sides of the path.  Some powerful enchantment
has been placed on them so they burst into life when a great warrior passes by
them.  The great path is covered with hard packed&N&+L dirt&N and all&+g weeds&N are
immediately removed.  This is the path of the warriors of&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N, a place
for the leaders of this great village to meet and to plan.  It is also a very
important street because it is where the warriors in training are first brought
into their trials of manhood.  Few women are ever allowed upon this trail, but
the one that are have deffinetly earned it.  Gazing east one can see the trail
continue to travel west through the many &N&+rblazing &N&+ytorches&N.  One can easily see
that this part of town is savage and very important.  One may travel west on
the &+LPath of the Warrior&N or east onto &N&+LLooga Street&N.&N

&N&+LA Dark and Musty Cave&N~
&+L   One of the older shamans uses this cave to distribute totems to any shamans
&+Lwho may have lost theirs.  The cave is not huge, but it is as large as a medium
&+Lsized room.  The cave is entirely natural and pitch dark.  There is a small
&+ywooden work bench&N&+L in the center of the room.  The totems that are sold here are
&+Lof the utmost importance for the magics the shamans use.  On the wall hang
&+Lsome tapestires that depict the glory of the &N&+Bogre&N&+L shamans.  It is safe to say
&+Lthat they are exaggerated.  One may travel west in the shaman caves.&N

&N&+LA Dark Corner of the Shaman Cave&N~
&+L   This dark corner of the shaman caves seems to be some kind of communal
&+Lgathering place for the shamans.  There are several tables and chairs made out
&+Lof what appears to be ironwood.  The rooms is filled with all kinds of totems.
&+LSome are broken, some are just prototypes for new styles of totems, and others
&+Lare only used as center pieces.  The amount of totems in this room is quite
&+Limpressive.  The room is often filled with the younger shamans boasting and
&+Llying about their heroic deeds.  Several large fights have happened here with
&+Lthe winners living and the losers dying an agonizing death.  The &N&+Bogres&N&+L who
&+Lmaintain these caves think of this room as a place to socialize.  One may go
&+Lnorth to the center of the shaman cave.&N

&+LA Dark Cave Used By the Shamans&N~
&+L   This section of the shaman caves is where the &N&+Bogre&N&+L teenagers are first
&+Linitiated into the dark arts of the shaman.  The room is used in an ancient and
&+Lvery well guarded tradition of initiation that is unknown to any civilization
&+Loutside of this mountain village.  The room smells of &N&+Ysulphur&N&+L and a deep musky
&+Lsmell.  The stone walls have been covered with ancient letters that are clearly
&+Lundecipherable to any, even the best trained shamans here.  No furniture or
&+Lrugs have been placed in this room adding to the general feel of emptiness.
&+LOne may travel to the east to the center of the shaman caves.&N

&+LThe Bottom of the Shaman Caves&N~
&+L   This lowest chamber of the shaman caves is the office of Gog, the head
&+Lshaman.  The cave is undecorated except for a few free standing torches that
&+Willuminate&N&+L the room.  The stone floor is unnaturally smooth, creating a very
&+Lodd and scary reflective surface.  A small urn rests here in the middle of the
&+Lroom.  In the urn some musty smelling incense burns and the smoke spirals
&+Lupwards.  There are some totems lying near the urn, used in some ancient shaman
&+Lspells.  One may use the stone stairs to travel up.&N

&NOn the Central Path of &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N,&+L Gatto&N Road&N~
&N   This part of town is quite a distance from the main gates of the city and
therefore is more dangerous to be in.  There is a great deal of uncivilized
fighting in this part of town, more like the tribe used to behave when it was
a nomadic tribe.  Quite often there is much infighting amongst rival&N&+B ogre&N
families.  The gate guards would usually bust up such annoyances just for the
sake of a new fight to break up the monotony of the job guarding &N&+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N.
There are fewer houses in this part of the town, most of the &N&+Bogre&N inhabitants
in the northern regions live in either houses they have taken over or even
some&N&+L caves&N in the side of the mountain.  A few of such &N&+Lcaves&N are visible from
this vantage point, looking like empty eye sockets on the face of the mountain.
There is a&N&+y wooden&N house to the west.  One may travel north, south or west from
this point.&N

&+LInside an &N&+bOgre&N&+L House&N~
&N   This &+Bogre&N house was built after the successful raid.  The house is built
from a combination of rock and&+y wood&N.  Part of this house was originally here
as a storage shed used by the &+Chumans &Nfor their livestock.  The small shed was
the basis and foundation for the larger stone building.  The stone has been
hauled to this site by the&+C human&N slaves and the house assembled by some wise
&+rduergar&N stone craftsman.  The house is inhabited by a wise and well respected
&+Bogre&N grandfather.  The place smells rather musty and closed up.  One may travel
east back out of the house.&N

&+LInside a Burnt House&N~
&+L   This house was almost completely gutted in a massive &N&+rfire&N&+L.  The &N&+Bogres&N&+L who
&+Llit this&N&+r fire&N&+L had no idea how fast this building would go up in &N&+rflames&N&+L.  Two
&N&+Bogres &N&+Ldied in the&N&+r fire&N&+L, unable to get out before the roof fell in.  Perhaps it
&+Lwas a sign from an immortal being that this entire raid was not supported by
&+Lthose in high positions.  Perhaps it was just dumb luck or dumb &N&+Bogres&N&+L that
&+Lcauses the de&N&+Wa&N&+Lths.  Either way this entire building is black with charcoal and
&+Lashes.  There is a thick layer of soot on the floor completely covering the
&+Lblackened boards and the burnt rugs.  The windows are either broken out or
&+Lstained with the sick &N&+yyellow &N&+Lcolor of smoke.  One may travel south to the road.&N

&+LIn the Dark Cellar Beneath the House&N~
&+L   The ceiling of this cellar is the floor of the house that was broken so
&+Lbadly that it gave away under the weight of those on it!&N
&N
&+L   This dark room was untouched during the &N&+Bogre&N&+L raid.  It has remained rather
&+Ldry considering the amount of damage done to the house above.  There isn't
&+Lreally anything down here save a few &N&+yshelves&N&+L and old &N&+yboxes&N&+L.  The dirt floor
&+Lfeels rather odd and spongy and it smells rather damp down here.  The walls
&+Lhave some&N&+G mold &N&+Lon them but they haven't rotted out yet.  There is a bad smell
&+Lcoming from the east, as if something has been using this place as a bathroom.
&+LThere is a &N&+yrope &N&+Lhanging down from the room above, perhaps the only way out of
&+Lthis cellar as the &N&+yladder &N&+Lhas been broken in half.&N

&+LThe Final Resting Place of a &N&+CHuman &N&+LFamily&N~
&+L   This dark cellar was originally used as a storehouse of extra food and
&N&+Wpotatoes&N&+L.  The cellar is roughly square and ten feet in any direction.  The
&+Lceiling is only six feet high and the floor is comprises of dirt.  This is the
&+Lfinal resting place of an entire &N&+Chuman &N&+Lfamily.  The glorious &N&+Bogre&N&+L raid forced
&+Lthese people into hiding.  Hunger quickly overtook this family who proceeded
&+Lto devour all their stored food.  The family died of starvation when the food
&+Lran out because they couldn't really leave this underground hiding place.  Some
&+Lassorted food containers lie upon the ground, devoid of any food.  This secret
&+Lhiding place is accessable through the secret wall to the west.&N

&NBelow A Large &N&+LWatch Tower&N~
&N   Large&N&+y wooden beams&N support the entire watch tower.  There is a beam for
every corner of the structure, all of which are firmly secured in stone
footings and then reanchored with another&+y wooden stake&N system.  The stone
floor is almost always dirty, not exactly a surprise for an&+B ogre&N village.
The ogres of &+BKr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N use this lookout tower to scan the surrounding areas
for easy targets to kill and plunder.  They use this area below the tower to
relieve themselves.  There is a great puddle of&+Y urine&N that has formed in the
eastern part of the room, which just happens to be the lowest point.  There is
also a &+ywooden plank&N with a hole in it that is used for the less appealing
aspect of waste removal.  This small privy is&+L filthy&N, with layers of crap on
the outside that never made it into the hole.  The hole more than likely just
leads to a large holding pit below.  There is a tough looking iron ladder
leading upwards to the floor of the watch tower.  One may travel up or west
from this point.

&NThe Shop of &N&+BMoga&N~
&N   The shop of&N&+B Moga&N is not a very large building.  It was more than likely
used by a family of little means to shelter themselves from the harsh mountain
winters.  &N&+BMoga&N'&N&+Bs&N shop is not clean by any measure and goods are scattered all
over the place.  A wide variety of goods are sold here, hanging on hooks or
displayed upon&N&+y wooden tables&N.  Three glass windows are on the eastern wall,
a rarity in the&N&+B ogre&N culture. &N&+B Moga &Nis so feared that the &+Bogre &Nchildren don't
dare to throw a rock through his glass windows.  If every window in town was
busted out, one could be sure that these windows would not be.  The windows
provide ample light to the store but at night a few strategically placed&N&+Y lamps
&N&+Willuminate&N the building enough.  There is much to see and buy here.  One may
leave the shop through the open door to the east.&N

being used as a work station to clean and polish some cheap looking &+cweapons&N.
There is a bed in each corner of the room, obviously for the many occupants.
By the general look of this building, it is safe to say that the &+Bogres&N who
live here are bachelors, for there is no sign of children or a womans touch.
The house is plain yet functional.  One may travel west out the&+y wooden door&N

&N&+yInside the Large Deer Hide Tent&N~
&N   This&+y deer hide tent &Nhas been constructed in the same manner the&+B ogre&N tribe
constructed them when they still wandered on the great &N&+gplains&N of&N&+g grass&N.  The
&+ytent&N is made from &+ytanned deer hide&N that has been stretched and stitched
together and then strung between sturdy &+gtrees &Nfound naturally growing at the
camp site.  The&+B ogre&N tribe tried to stay near &+gforested&N areas so they could
construct such shelters, but now that they have taken this&+C human &Ntown, they
usually live in the&+y wooden &Nhomes that have already been built.  The&+B ogre &Nwho
lives here is from the old school of the&+B ogre &Ntribe, not wanting to give up
the old ways.  This is one of the few&+B ogre &N&+ytents&N left in this part of the
world, for the nomadic tribes have either moved into caves or&+y wooden&N buildings.
&N   The&+y tent&N smells like cooked meat, probably roasted over the &+rcampfire&N.  The
floor is&N&+L dirt&N but has been swept clear of any&+L t&N&+gwi&N&+Lgs&N or &+Ldebris&N by someone.  The
furniture here is almost totally unused, only to store things upon.  There is
a large &N&+yoaken table&N covered with many&+y wooden &Ncarvings and various talismans
used for luck or for spirit warding.  One may travel back into the town by
opening the &+yhide flap&N to the south, or travel east in the &N&+Bogre &N&+ytent&N.&N

&+yIn the Back of the Large Deer Hide Tent&N~
&N   This back room of the &N&+ydeer hide tent&N is essentially the sleeping room of
this domicile.  There is a large and reinforced cot near the wall of the &N&+ytent&N
that is also made out of &N&+ytanned deer hides&N.  Long strips of &N&+ydeer hide&N hang down
from the ceiling in an effort to further dry them.  Many odd pictograms have
been drawn on the hide with&N&+L charcoal&N.  The pictograms depict many great battles
and layouts of some of the earlier camp layouts.  The&N&+B ogre&N who lives here is of
the older generations of the tribe that still adhere to the old ways.
&N   The &N&+ytent&N smells rather pleasant, like cooked meat and &N&+yleather&N oils.  There
is a large &N&+ypile of furs &Nin the corner, probably this &N&+Bogres &Ntraveling gear.  The
ground has been swept clean, down to the hard &N&+Lsoil&N.  There is a small&N&+y barrel&N in
the corner of the &N&+ytent&N that is filled with some clear &N&+bwater&N.  There is also a
small&N&+y wooden table &Nthat appears to be as old as time itself.  One may travel
west from this point in the&N&+y deer hide tent&N.&N

A sad looking &N&+Chuman&N has been chained to the wall, awaiting his death.&N

&n  This chained &+chuman&n unfortunately survived the fall of this once great city.
Now he is here cowering in a corner, awaiting the death that surely follows
his steps closely now.  Hungry &+Bogres&n have been looking him over with more and
more appreciation as of late.  He huddles in a &+ydirty&n heap hoping to hide from
that death.      &n

&+LA de&N&+rr&N&+Lan&N&+rg&N&+Led&N&+B ogre&N&+L shaman tears around looking for something to kill.&N
~
&N   This crazy shaman is more than a little pissed.  His eyes are filled with
a crazy &N&+rrage&N as he looks for someone to kill.  His hair is long and is wildly
layered over his head.  There are large patches of shaved scalp visible, which
are covered with &N&+Rred tatoos&N.  He once had a place in the&N&+B ogre &Nsociety but now
is regarded as an untouchable.  He is supported by the tribe, but not talked
to.  He is allowed to do whatever he wants, he just isn't allowed to speak with
others.  He is powerful for a young shaman but does not know nearly enough to
become overly powerful.&N

&+Ldoesn't eat anything but meat.  He is a savage and feral creature that will
&+Lattack any creature it feels like attacking.&N

ogre elderly old~
&Nan elderly &N&+Bogre&N~
An ancient &N&+Bogre&N sits here silently, looking both timeless and noble.&N
~
&N   This ancient &N&+Bogre &Nhas been through everything this tribe has experienced
in the past hundred years.  Not even he is sure of exactly how old he is, but
he was a young boy when the tribe still wandered nomadically around the vast
plains.  He is covered with many long and wicked looking &N&+Lscar&N&+rs&N, proof of his
worth in battle even still.  He was on the front line of the&N&+B ogre&N raid, even
at his advanced age.  His hair has turned almost&N&+W stark white&N, bleached by the
sun and by time.  He prefers to live in his&N&+y deer hide tent&N, much like the old
ways of his people.
&N   Although he could still pick up a large &N&+csword&N to defend himself, this &N&+Bogre&N
rarely does.  Instead he enjoys watching over the younger &+Bogres&N as they play
and wrestle.  He is no longer filled with the &N&+rbloodlust&N and savagery of the
warring people he lives amongst.  He is a kind creature and is revered by his
tribe.  His name has been forgotten by even him, but is simply called "the
important one" by all in the city of&N&+B Kr&N&+Lagth&N&+Bor&N.&N

&N   This large &+Bogre &Nhas joined up with the Mercenaries of the &+rRed Eye&N.  The
guild is in no way secret, but few are allowed to join.  The &+Bogres &Nare not
exactly team players, as their raids are often not coordinated with the raids
of the village.  He is a huge creature and is covered with many gross looking
battle scars.  His thick layer of muscle covers his body like a shield of
strength.  Although he is a brutal fighter, he is quite intelligent.  The &N&+rRed&N
&N&+rEye&N does not accept morons. &N

neither bothers nor affects her &N&+Bogre &Ncaptives.  She was once a pretty young
girl, but her years of captivity have turned her into an ugly, sullen thing.
She still looks strong, but probably has put her mind in another place, so now
she mearly exists instead of lives.&N

He still does not have many scars on his body, and his face is remarkably clear

~
Q
&N   "Thank you so much.  What the heck, i'll finish this mace and let you just
have it.  You deserve it."&N
