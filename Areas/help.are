-1 CLASSES~

A class is a profession or chosen field of study.  Classes dictate what
skills you have, what spells you may learn, and how you fight or act.
Not all classes are available to each race, due to physical or mental
deficiencies.

You can find a chart detailing the classes available to each race by 
typing "help classlist".

The following is a list of the classes that can be chosen by a player
during the character generation process.  More information about each
class can be obtained by typing in "help <class name>".

-1 SKILLS~
Each class is granted certain skills, which represent areas in which
a new character has received some basic amount of training.  As a
character uses a skill and goes up in levels, he becomes better at these
skills.  The command "skills" will list all the skills you currently
possess and what level you have them at.  Some skills will only be

-1 RULES~

Unfortunately, because of the wide variety of situations that can arise
on Basternae, this rules section is rather lengthy and boring.  It has
been broken down into numerous sub-topics to make finding a certain rule
easier.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE RULES.  IGNORANCE OF A RULE
IS NO EXCUSE FOR BREAKING A RULE.  

The following topics are available:

     HELP RULES GENERAL       - general policies and rules
     HELP RULES EQUIPMENT     - rules concerning equipment and how
                                it should be used
     HELP RULES ARTIFACTS     - rules about artifacts
     HELP RULES BUGS          - rules concerning bugs and what players
                                should do when they find bugs
     HELP RULES MULTI         - multiplaying rules
     HELP RULES PUNISHMENT    - what happens when you break rules              
     HELP RULES DISCLAIMER    - our disclaimer
     HELP RULES REIMBURSEMENT - what happens when a bug claims your
                                equipment
     HELP RULES IMMORTALS     - how the rules apply to gods and how
                                players should try to interact with
                                them
     HELP RULES RACEWARS      - rules regarding racewars and player
                                killing
     HELP RULES NAMES         - rules regarding names of players

~

0 'RULES NAMES' NAMES NAME~

Basternae is not necessarily a role-playing mud, but we do have strict
standards on names of the players.  We will not accept any of the
following:

Type						Example
Foul language					No example should be needed
"Real" names					Brian, Casey, Leon
Real words, compound words, or slang terms	Dagger, Windwalker
Names of characters from books, movies, etc.	Gandalf, Belgarion, Drizzt
Variations using intentional spelling errors,	Whysper, Blayde
backwards spellings, hooked on phonics
Historical figures				Arthur, Patton
Random garbage					Diouhljl, Xxxxxx
Obvious storage character names			Skistore
Insulting or demeaning names			Skisucks, Bitemeski
Names of gods or dieties			Thor, Hermes

All of the above rules apply to both English and non-English languages.

Basically, try to make up a fantasy name that you aren't "stealing"
from another source.

If we catch you with an illegal name, we'll usually ask you to
petition a new name.  We'll rename you and you won't have to delete
or re-roll.  However, certain names will get you termed immediately
(those using foul language or insults).  If you're really stupid
about it, we'll have no qualms about sitebanning you.

If you feel your name is borderline, just petition and we'll be more
than happy to made a judgement call on it.
~

0 'RULES GENERAL'~

1.  DON'T DO ANYTHING THE OVERLORDS WILL CONSIDER CHEESY.  This rule
    should cover all the miscellaneous situations that aren't covered
    specifically in the rules.  Even if we don't state something is
    illegal in the rules, doesn't mean it's not.  If the gods feel you
    are doing some abusive that's not in the spirit of the game, you
    will be punished.
2.  Players shoud settle their own disputes.  Talking to a god should
    be a last resort.  Use the petition channel if you need to consult
    with a god, but try to deal with matters yourself first.
3.  Hacking or stealing the password of other people's characters is
    not allowed.
4.  Trading or giving away characters is not allowed.  The person that
    originally created the character must play it at all times.  The
    only exception to this rule is shared storage characters, which is
    discussed in HELP RULES MULTI.
5.  You may only have a single guilded character at any time.
~

0 'RULES EQUIPMENT'~

READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY: Your primary character must wear his
best gear at all times. This means you have to wear your best stuff
for raids, zones, and scouting.

Secondary characters must also use the best equipment available to
them that is NOT in use by the primary character.  This also includes
using the secondaries for raiding, zoning, and scouting of any kind.

If you're unsure about which character is primary and which are
secondaries, don't risk it.  Always move gear between the character
you are currently using.  If the admin's think what you're doing is
cheesy, you'll be termed.

In addition, you must do your absolute best to equip your characters
before raiding.  If you have equipment on your storage character, use
it.  If the guild storage chest contains stuff, take it.  If you have
money (either your own or belonging to the guild), you must take it
and make every effort to purchase the best equipment you can.  Do not
decline equipment offered to you by friends simply because you want to
raid and don't want to risk losing it.

You may NEVER raid or scout naked or with newbie/minor created equipment,
even if you have nothing on storage.  You must re-equip before raiding,
or scouting.

The only exception to the "best equipment" rules is for corpse retrieval
_immediately_ after a death.  If you die, you may attempt to go back to
your corpse and retrieve ONLY YOUR EQUIPMENT.  You may not try to get
equipment from the corpses of other members of your party.  _Immediately_
means three minutes.  If you can't get to your corpse in three minutes
or less, don't go out until you have fully equipped again.

Even this exception has an exception, however.  In a racewars situation,
you cannot keep going out to loot.  You can go out ONE TIME after you
die to attempt to get your corpse.  After that, you must re-equip
fully before attempting to get your corpse.

Lets give an example to show what I mean:

An evil guild and a goodie guild fight near the goodie guild's hall.  The
evils win, and are in the process of looting equipment from the corpses.
One goodie who died, lets call him Toom, runs back out to try and loot
his corpse.  He dies again.  He may not perform any more CR actions
until he is fully re-equipped.  His other guild members may not attempt
to loot his corpse until they are fully equipped (but they may each make
one attempt to loot their own corpses).
~

0 'RULES ARTIFACTS'~

Artifacts must be on "primary" characters.  Since the issue of "primary"
characters can get confusing, use your best judgement and/or ask the
administrators.  If you have a character in a guild, that character is
your primary, regardless of playtimes.

A single character can only have one artifact.

Artifacts must always be equipped or carried.  This means that you
can't give an artifact to someone to 'protect' it, you shouldn't 
drop and hide it to avoid losing it, etc.  About to get killed by
a mob that might turn you into a dracolich and nuke all of your
equipment? Bummer, you HAVE to keep that artifact with you.  The
only way you should pass off an artifact that you are actively 
using is when it is pried from your dead fingers.  If you acquire 
an artifact that you are unable to use, yes, you an give it away
to someone that can, but once you do, it is theirs to keep or
lose.

Even if you can't use an artifact (like goodies getting a shaman 
artifact), it must be carried so that the other side has a chance
to get it back.

If the admin's feel the player holding an artifact isn't "active"
enough, the artifact will be taken and put back to its original location.

Artifacts are on a "random load" timer and do not load up every boot
in zones.  This means that if an artifact is reset and put back in
its home, it will not be there every boot.
    
If you are unsure if a piece of equipment is considered an artifact,
ask.  For the most part any unique piece of equipment, including
stuff from quests, is considered an artifact, even if it's not
completely overpowering.
~

0 'RULES BUGS'~

1.  Report all bugs you find using the 'bug' command.  If it's an
    emergency, use the 'petition' command to inform the gods.
2.  Once you've reported the bug, do not continue to use it.
3.  If you find a bug, don't report it, and continue to use it, you
    will be punished.
4.  Bugs consist of errors in the code and errors in zones, such as
    the infamous "money bugs" that crop up.
~

0 'RULES MULTI' 'RULES MULTI-PLAYING'~

Multi-playing is a complex and confusing part of the game, and one that
you should make every effort to understand.  Failure to follow the
policies set in these rules will result in HARSH punishment.  Ignorance is
not an excuse.

1.  You may NOT have more than one character on at ANY time.  THIS
    INCLUDES LINK-DEAD CHARACTERS.  You must rent or camp out your other
    character BEFORE you bring on a new one.  The ONLY exception is as
    follows:  you may have two characters on in the same room (in an inn
    or other rentable location) for the purpose of exchanging or storing
    equipment.

2.  You may NOT bring on a character belonging to the opposite side of the
    racewars for TWO HOURS after logging off the first character.  No
    exceptions to this rule will be allowed.

   Example: Madra is a Gnome and gets bored of playing for a while.  She
   decides to log on a newbie Drow Elf.  Ooops, big mistake on her part,
   since she's now broken rule number two and we kindly admins nuke both
   chars.

3.  You may NOT bring on another character for the purpose of using it
    to act as a "translator" to get around the language barrier.

4.  You may NOT bring on another character in order to retrieve
    equipment for a character that has died, REGARDLESS of whether that
    other character's corpse has decomposed or not.  This includes, but is
    not limited to, creating "newbies" to retrieve corpses or eq
    REGARDLESS of who's corpse is being retrieved.

5.  You may NOT use a second character to cast spells on another. This
    rule also applies to logging another character on as a "target" for a 
    spell.
    
6.  You CANNOT share characters.  You cannot give a character away. You
    cannot loan characters out for any reason. If we catch you, we will
    delete every character you have.  To make sure you understand: You
    can NOT loan or trade characters.  

   Example1: Tony is a player with a high level shaman and secondary high
   level warrior.  He wants to go out and raid with his shaman, but wants
   a basher along with him.  He asks a friend of his to play his warrior
   for a while so they can group and go kill people.  Later on, Tony logs
   out his shaman and starts playing the warrior himself.  Oooops, big
   mistake on his part, because Tony just broke rule number eight and now
   both characters will be terminated.

    The only exception to this is shared storage characters, which may
    never leave the inn room they are rented in.  A maximum of three people
    may share a storage character.

7.  You may not trade or give characters to other people.  Once a player
    is created, the same person must play that character until he is
    deleted.  You may not trade one character for another, nor may you
    give a character away for free or for reimbursement of any kind.

8.  You may NOT use a second character with the sole purpose being to
    camp near an equipment repop site or to act as a portal/moonwell
    target for a zone. Despite the importance of equipment, hoarding
    equipment by this means is deplorable, dishonorable, and ILLEGAL.
    Using characters as a target for racewars in this fashion is also
    illegal.

7.  You may NOT log on another character to take revenge for another
    of your character's that was just killed, looted, stolen from, hit
    with a spell, or had any other ill effect placed on him by another
    character FOR TWO HOURS after the incident occurred.
    
9.  You may NEVER scout with low level characters or newbies, just to
    avoid risking a primary or high level secondary character.  Using
    newbies to scout for targets for raids or to do corpse retrieval/
    looting is extremely cheesy and will result in angry admins.

10. You cannot transfer equipment from a character on one side of the
    racewars to another.  This means if you have a stacked goodie char and
    want to start playing an evil character, you must get all new stuff
    with the evil.  You cannot have other people transfer the gear for
    you, and you most certainly cannot have someone kill and loot your
    first character and give it to the second.
~

0 'RULES PUNISHMENT'~

The administrative staff for Basternae can deal with the players any
way they want.  We don't have to give you a warning or a second chance
(but we usually do).  

We do not have set policies for punishment.  It's up to each individual
god to deal with things how he sees fit.

We can and will siteban people who we don't want playing on Basternae.
If a siteban "hurts" innocent bystanders because they can no longer
connect to Basternae, we're sorry, but that happens.  Sitebanning is
our final option and we don't like doing it.
~

0 'RULES DISCLAIMER'~

While the administrators of Basternae attempt to maintain an environment
suitable for gaming, we cannot control all the actions of our players.
We will do our best to provide for the entertainment of the majority of
our players.  Spamming or harrassment will not be tolerated on this mud,
but the admins are not responsible if it does.

We reserve the right to run this mud how we think is best.  If a player
doesn't approve of our methods, he or she is welcome to leave and find
another mud.  We reserve the right to be jerks or worse.  We reserve the
right to change things without telling a single person.  We reserve the
right to pretty much do whatever we want, actually.

We also aren't responsible for player stupidity.  If you give out your
password to someone, or download a virus from another player who tells
you about this "really cool game" he has, or do anything else on the mud
that affects your real-life, the admins cannot be blamed.

By playing on this mud, you agree to these terms.

~

0 'RULES REIMBURSEMENT' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~

We do not give out reimbursements, unless there is a wide-spread
corruption in our player database.  

If you lose an item to a mistake or bug, you will not be given a
replacement.  This includes situations like lost or stolen items,
decayed corpses, losses caused by crashes or reboots, hacked accounts,
changes to the game, or guild hall chest or player ship malfunctions.
~

0 'RULES IMMORTALS'~

The immortals of Basternae put a lot of time and effort into the game
and should be treated with respect.  We don't care if you like us, but
we won't tolerate extreme insults or slander.

The immortals of Basternae can and do play mortal characters, but make
every effort to keep mortal and immortal affairs seperate.  The
administrators of Basternae do not show favortism to one racewars side
or another.  We make changes to the game based on game balance issues,
not our mortal characters, guilds, or personal interests.
~

0 'RULES RACEWARS'~

1.  Player killing is legal and expected.  The objective of the game is
    to kill players on the opposite side of the racewars, but same side
    pkilling is allowed.
2.  Player killing in goodie hometowns is affected by the JUSTICE code.
    Read help justice for more information.
3.  If you have multiple characters, you may not use one of the characters
    to gain revenge for the death, looting, or any other ill effects that
    happen to your other character until a period of two hours has passed.
4.  If you involved in any racewars situation (attacking or scouting)
    you may not log on another character to take part in any racewars
    activity for two hours.

    To give you an example, lets say your level 15 goblin warrior runs
    into some goodies in a zone.  Regardless of whether your warrior
    was attacked or not, as long as he or a group member spotted the
    goodies in any fashion, you cannot log in another character for
    two hours to do any type of raiding, counter-raiding, and so on.
~

-1 ! !! 'EVENT DESIGNATORS'~
   {o{wEvent Designators{x
       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry
       in the history list.

       {o{w!{x      Start a history substitution.
       {o{w!!{x     Refer to the previous command.  This is  a  synonym
              for `!-1'.
       {o{w!{yn{x     Refer to command line {o{yn{x.
       {o{w!-{yn{x    Refer to the current command line minus {o{yn{x.
       {o{w!{ystring{x
              Refer to the most recent command starting with
              {o{ystring{x.
       {o{w!?{ystring{x
              Refer to the most recent command containing {o{ystring{x.

       History is written by Zen (vasc@camoes.rnl.ist.utl.pt)
~

56 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.

This command is logged and only to be used with special approval.
~

0 AERIAL CASTING~
Applied skill: 
     Paladins [Level 1]
     Anti-Paladins [Level 1]
     Sorcerers [Level 1]
     Clerics [Level 1]
     Druids [Level 1]
     Psionicists [Level 1]
     Necromancers [Level 1]
     Shamans [Level 1]
     Rangers [Level 1]
     Hunters [Level 1]

Aerial casting is simply casting while flying above the ground.  It is 
considerably more difficult to cast spells in the air.  It is a skill that
only improves with use and level increases.

See Also:  AERIAL COMBAT, SPELL FAILURE, CAST, SPELL SLOT, SPELL CIRCLES, 
CASTER, MAGIC 
~

0 AERIAL COMBAT~
Applied skill:  All classes

Aerial combat is any fight above ground level.  This skill improves with 
use and with level increases.  You cannot engage in aerial combat without
flying.

See Also:  AERIAL CASTING, SPELL FAILURE, CAST, SPELL SLOT, SPELL CIRCLES, 
CASTER, MAGIC

~
0 AFK~
Syntax: afk

AFK notifies those on the mud that are you away from your keyboard.  It will
toggle it between off and on states.  Your AFK status will show up next to
your name on the WHO and in the room you are located in.
~

0 AGILITY~
Attribute

Agility is a measure of your overall coordination and quickness.  It
represents your reflexes and balance.  It is the primary attribute for
rogues, but other classes benefit from agility as well.

Some races are more agile than others.  The small and quick halflings and
drow elves are extremely agile, while ogres and centaurs are much less so
because of their size and slow reflexes.

See also: STATS, STATISTICS, ATTRIBUTES
~

0 ALERT~

Syntax: alert

Alert is used to bring yourself out of a deeply relaxed state.  Sometimes
if you cannot move use alert to become unrelaxed.

See Also:  STAND, SLEEP, RECLINE, SIT, REST
~

56 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias <word> <substitution>
Syntax: unalias <word>

The ALIAS command allows limited shortening of command names.  Aliases can
generate more than one command using the symbol ';'.

ALIAS with no arguments lists your current aliases.

'$' is a special symbol which means the argument of the command typed.
~

56 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~

0 AREAS~
Syntax: areas

AREAS shows you all of the areas in the game and includes information
such as the author's name and the suggested levels players should be
before exploring the zone.
~

0 'ARMOR CLASS'~
Armor class, sometimes abbreviated as AC, is a value that represents how
protected a character is.  Armor class is based on a scale from +100 to
-100, with +100 being the worst possible armor (naked), while -100 is the
best.

Equipment can raise and lower your armor class.  The lower your AC, the
harder it is to hit you.  The help entry for THAC0 (to-hit armor class
zero) contains more information on the combat system and how armor class
affects it.

See also: THAC0
~

0 ARTIFACTS~

Artifacts are weapons or items of immense power.  They are very hard to
obtain and there is only one of the artifacts in the game....EVER.

Artifacts must be on "primary" characters.  Since the issue of "primary"
characters can get confusing, use your best judgement and/or ask the
administrators.  If you have a character in a guild, that character is
your primary, regardless of playtimes.

A single character can only have one artifact.

Artifacts must always be equipped or carried.  This means that you
can't give an artifact to someone to 'protect' it, you shouldn't 
drop and hide it to avoid losing it, etc.  About to get killed by
a mob that might turn you into a dracolich and nuke all of your
equipment? Bummer, you HAVE to keep that artifact with you.  The
only way you should pass off an artifact that you are actively 
using is when it is pried from your dead fingers.  If you acquire

Even if you can't use an artifact (like goodies getting a shaman 
artifact), it must be carried so that the other side has a chance
to get it back.

If the admin's feel the player holding an artifact isn't "active"
enough, the artifact will be taken and put back to its original location.

Artifacts are on a "random load" timer and do not load up every boot
in zones.  This means that if an artifact is reset and put back in
its home, it will not be there every boot.
    
If you are unsure if a piece of equipment is considered an artifact,
ask.  For the most part any unique piece of equipment, including
stuff from quests, is considered an artifact, even if it's not
completely overpowering.

56 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).  Thus, AT will not work to private locations.
~

0 ATTRIBUTES~
Syntax: attributes

ATTRIBUTES will give you a list of information about your character,
including level, race, class, age, height, weight, and your attribute
scores.

There are eight primary attributes:
     Strength       Constitution        Agility        Dexterity
     Intelligence   Wisdom              Charisma       Luck

Each of these attributes can range from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst
and 100 the best.  However, please note that the 0 to 100 scale is based
on the race of the character.  A score of 100 strength for an ogre is not
the same as 100 strength for a gnome.  The ogre is still much more powerful.
The score of 100 indicates that he is the best he can be for his race,
while the gnome's score of 100 indicates that he is as strong as possible for
a gnome.

0 AUTO CONFIG~
Syntax: auto
Syntax: config
Syntax: config +<option>
Syntax: config -<option>

AUTO shows the status of some of your character behavior options.

The CONFIG command configures some of your character behavior.  With no
options, CONFIG shows you your current settings (identical to the AUTO
command).  With a plus or minus sign and an option, CONFIG turns that
option on or off.

The options are:

    EDITINFO  You see extra info on rooms (IMMORTAL ONLY).
    AUTOEXIT  You automatically see exits.
    BLANK     You have a blank line before your prompt.
    BRIEF     You see brief descriptions only.
    COLOUR    You see ANSI coloured text.
    COMBINE   You see object lists in combined format.
    PROMPT    You have a prompt.
    TELNETGA  You receive a telnet GA sequence.

You can also type AUTOEXIT, BLANK, BRIEF, COLOUR, or COMBINE directly from
the prompt to toggle the status of these options.  See the helps for these
commands.
~

0 AUTOEXIT~
Syntax: autoexit

AUTOEXIT toggles your ability to automatically see exits as you enter
a room.

See CONFIG to find out which toggle is on and which is off.
~

0 BACKSTAB BS~
Applied skill
     Assassin [Level 1]
     Bard [Level 1]
     Mercenary [Level 1]
     Thief [Level 1]

Syntax: backstab <target>
Aggressive: yes

A backstab is an attempt to sneak up on a victim and place a weapon in a
critical spot in his back, doing more damage than a normal attack.  The
success of the backstab is dependant on the skill of the person attempting
to stab the target.

Only piercing weapons can be used to backstab.  Assassins and rogues with
good enough skills in backstabbing and dual wielding weapons can
double-backstab if they are wielding two piercing weapons.

You cannot backstab a target while in combat.  Backstabbing is an aggressive
action.

See also: CIRCLE, DUAL WIELD
~

56 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout
Syntax: bamfout <message>

The standard messages for GOTO are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.  Without arguments,
these reset the messages to their defaults.
~

0 BANDAGE~

Applied Skill:  All classes
Syntax: Bandage <target>

Bandage can be used by any player to try help repair an incapacitated player
or mob.  The command must have a target and it can be stacked.  A typical
bandage will help the incapacitated target regain a few hit points or it may
further hurt the target.  Once the targets hit points returns to above zero,
bandage will no longer help them.

~

0 BASH~
Applied skill
     Warrior [Level 1]
     Paladin [Level 1]
     Anti-Paladin [Level 1]
     Berserker [Level 1]
     Mercenaries [Level 1]
     Rangers [Level 1]
     Hunters [Level 1]
     
Syntax:  bash <target>
Aggressive: yes

Bashing is a skill used to knock another player or mob down.  It is most
effective while the person trying to bash is wearing a shield.  Bashing is
a very level dependant skill.  For example:  A level 56 player will hit bash
a lot more frequently than a level 1 player.  Missing a bash will send you
toppling to the ground where you will take extra damage.

Size does matter!  A basher can only bash opponents of the same or one size
smaller size.

Note:  Paladins and Anti-Paladins can bash effectively without a shield.

SEE ALSO: BODYSLAM
~

0 BERSERK~
Applied or reflexive skill
     Berserker [Level 1]
     Warrior [Level 1]

Syntax: berserk
Aggressive: no

Berserk represents a massive adrenaline rush and an almost mindless rage
and need to kill.  Berserking causes a person to ignore his personal safety
and that of his friends in his lust for blood.

When berserked, the strength and constitution of the player go up, but
dexterity, agility, intelligence, and wisdom all drop.  The player will do
more damage and have more health, but will be easier to hit as well.  When
the effect wears off, the player will return to his normal stats.  If the
drop in hit points because of the player's constitution takes his total to
less than 0, he will die.

You cannot cast spells, flee, or perform many other actions while berserked.
While berserk, you may attack friends because of the blinding rage you are
engulfed in.

You can attempt to start/stop a berserk rage by typing 'berserk'.  Your level
and skill will determine the success of your attempt.

See also: BERSERKER
~

0 BLANK~
Syntax: blank

BLANK toggles existance of a blank before your prompt.

See CONFIG to find out which toggle is on and which is off.
~

0 BODYSLAM~
Innate skill for the larger races only! 
     Ogres, Trolls,  Barbarians and Centaurs

NOTE:   Bodyslam can only be applied by Warriors and Mercenaries.

Syntax:  bodyslam

Bodyslam is a powerful action used only while a player is not engaged in
battle.  A successful bodyslam will knock its target to the ground and
stun them for a brief period of time.  If you miss a bodyslam you will
fall to the ground in the reclined position and be stunned.  While 
reclined a player will take a great amount of damage.

One cannot bodyslam while engaged.  The action becomes easier with higher
levels.

See Also:  BASH

~
0 BRIEF~
Syntax: brief

BRIEF toggles whether or not you automatically see verbose descriptions
of rooms when you enter them.

See CONFIG to find out which toggle is on and which is off.
~

0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These three commands will take a message and record it into a file, so the
administrative staff can use your feedback to improve the game.

If you encounter a bug that is critical to the game (such as the game
crashing every time you try to use a specific item), let the administrators
know immediately by using the PETITION command.

See also: PETITION
~

0 BUY~
Syntax: buy [quantity] <object> [shopkeeper]

BUY will allow you to try and purchase an item from a shopkeeper.  If no
quantity is given, the mud will assume you would like to buy one item. 
If no shopkeeper is given, the first shopkeeper in the room will be chosen.

BUY, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a player
to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if the command "LIST DAGGER" showed you that a shopkeeper had
five daggers, you could type "BUY 3.DAGGER".

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would
attempt to buy three daggers, not the third dagger.

Prices in shops can be affected by a player's charisma.

See also: SELL, LIST, VALUE, MONEY, SHOPS
~

0 CAMP~
Syntax: camp

CAMPing allows you to exit the game while in the wilderness, away from the
friendly confines of an inn.  Camping requires a certain amount of time
before it can be done.  During this time while you are setting up your camp,
you can not leave the room or enter combat.  You will enter the game at the
same spot where you camped.

If you go linkdead while camping, the camping timer will stop.

See also: RENT, QUIT
~

0 CARVE~
Applied Skill:  All classes
Syntax:  carve <name of corpse> <body part>

NOTE:  Carving requires that you are wielding a dagger.

Carving can be done on other players corpses.  After the player is dead
you can carve many different pieces from the corpse.  To find out what
body parts remain in the corpse type, carve <corpse name>.  To then carve
one of the parts out of the corpse use the syntax listed above.  You can
then even wear some of the body parts.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> [target|object]
Syntax: cast '<spell>' [target|object]

CAST is a command used to call upon the forces of magic to perform some task
for the player.

The spell being cast must be in the caster's memory.  Magic users must
memorize their spells from spellbooks using the MEMORIZE command, while
priests use the PRAY command and do not need spellbooks.

If the spell name is more than one word, you must enclose it in a single
quote.  For example: cast 'cure light wounds' Ski, where Ski is the target
of the spell.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.

You can also abbreviate spell names.  You must type in a minimum amount of
letters to make the spell "unique", so the mud knows which spell you mean.
For example, cast 'cure' Ski would not work for casting cure light wounds,
because there are multiple cure spells.  Typing cast 'cure l' Ski would,
since the other cure spells do not include the letter l.

Many spells require a target.  That target can be a player or an object.
If a spellcaster is casting a spell on himself, he can simply use "me" or
"self" as the target.  

If a spellcaster is casting an offensive spell while in combat, and the
target is the enemy the spellcaster is fighting, the spell will be
automatically directed at the enemy if no target is given.

CAST allows the use of the #.target format, where # is a number.  This
allows a player to choose a specific target from a group of players, mobs,
or items with the same keywords.

For example, if there were four demons in a room and the spellcaster wanted
to cast a fireball on the third one, he would type:

     cast 'fireball' 3.demon

Make sure you include the period between the number of the target and the
name.  If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, the
spell wouldn't work because it would attempt to cast the spell "3", which
obviously doesn't exist. 

There is help available for each individual spell.  The command "SPELLS"
will give a player a list of all spells he can obtain.  "help <class> spells"
will bring up a list of all the spells available to the desired class.

Syntax: channels -<channel>

With no options, CHANNELS shows you your current channels.  With a plus or
minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.
~

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: colour    Toggles colour mode on/off

&+WThe Book of Basternae Ansi Codes&n

First things first.  The main thing to understand when using our version of
ansi color is:  you can SET things, or CLEAR ALL (back to white on black), but
you cannot just turn off bold, or blink.

There are 4 types of ansi control sequences:
&<N>|<n> -   reset everything, back to 'n'ormal (white on black).  This is also
             done for every newline, to eliminate 'bleed-through' colors.
& + <color> -  set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase,the BOLD
             (bright/light) bit is also set (and will STAY set) until either
             a newline, or &<N> is done.
& - <color> -  set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase,the BLINK
             bit will be set (same as for &+ above).
&=<bg><fg> - set both background <bg> and foreground <fg> color, exactly
the
             same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
             seperately.

w - &+Wwh&n&+wite&n    l - &+Lblack   &n r - &+Rr&n&+red &n   b - &+Bbl&n&+bue &ng - &+Ggr&n&+geen

~

0 CHARISMA~
Attribute

Charisma is a combination of appearance and personality.  Charisma is the
mark of leaders and entertainers, and it is the primary attribute for bards.
Charisma can affect how monsters perceive you, and can affect things such as
shop prices.

0 COMBINE~
Syntax: combine

COMBINE toggles your seeing combined format of identical items in the room.

See CONFIG to find out which toggle is on and which is off.
~

0 COMMANDS~
Syntax: commands

COMMANDS shows you all of the commands (except socials) available to you.

See also: SOCIALS
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object1> [object2]

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory or equipment list.  If both
objects are weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage.
If both objects are armor, it will report the one with the higher armor class.

COMPARE doesn't take into account any special affects on objects, so it can't
be considered an accurate measure of the power of an object.

COMPARE with one object compares an object in your inventory to the object you
are currently wearing or equipping of that same type.  It only compares against
the first item it finds, so if you are wielding two swords, it would only
compare against the first one.
~

0 'COMPLAINT FORM'~

Because of the amount of complaints we have been getting about our game
recently, the staff of Basternae has decided to make the job of the
players (which is to complain, of course) at bit easier.  The following
form should speed up the response time of the Basternae staff, ensuring
that we are able to give in to every whim of the players in a timely and
efficient manner.

Please bear with us, however, if we still seem a bit slow in changing the
mud code after you submit this form.  The sheer amount of people who know
more than the admins of Basternae is simply amazing, and we are constantly
struggling to keep up with the tide of mistakes and errors that we have
made up to this point in time.

Make sure you fill out the complaint form fully.  If you see multiple
options in parenthesis, such as (one/two/three), please only choose one.
If you see ____ lines in front of a list of options, choose as many as you
like, unless the form tells you specifically to do otherwise.

---------

Dear (sirs/admins of Basternae/bastards/assholes),

I would like to file a (complaint/complaint/big complaint) about your mud,
Basternae: Phoenix Rising.  

I think ____________________________ (insert race/class here) is horribly
underpowered.  I mean, come ON!  They don't even get (triple 
attack/quadruple attack/deathfield/all of the above).  All of the other
(classes/races) are so much better than ________________________ (insert
race/class here) that it's not even fun to play anymore.  At the minimum,
you should give them ___________________ (insert new ability here), and
the following:
     ___ judgement
     ___ major para
     ___ biofeedback
     ___ instant-kill
     ___ dragon breath
     ___ other _______________________

(Goodies/evils) are also so much more powerful than my side of racewars, I
don't see how we can even play.  You gods are so biased for
(goodies/evils)!  Why do (goodies/evils) have _____________________ (insert
race/class/ability) here and we don't?

I have been playing this game since (you opened/Duris/pre-wipe Duris/beta 
Duris) so I know what I'm talking about.  I could run this mud
(10/100/1000/a jillion) times better than you guys.

So, in conclusion, you are the most (moronic/stupid/grossly incompetent)
(buffoons/jerks/spawns of Satan) to ever run a mud.  Maybe you gods should
stop (cheating/lying/performing lewd acts with your sister) and start
running a decent mud for a change.

(Yours truly/Bite me whores/Go to hell and die/Love),
______________________________ (insert your name here)
~

0 CONSENT~
Syntax: consent [character|who]

Certain actions require consent between one player and another to be
performed.  You agree to allow the other player to perform an action on
you by giving them your consent.

An example of actions that require consent are:
     Joining a group
     Having the resurrect spell cast on a corpse

You can only consent one person at a time.  You can change it as often as
you wish.  You do not have to be consented to the group leader to stay in
the group, for example.

You must be able to see the person you want to consent.

Typing CONSENT with no arguments will revoke your consent.

Typing CONSENT WHO will list the people who are consented to you.

See also: GROUP
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <target>

CONSIDER will compare your level and experience with that of the target and
give you a rough estimate of your chances of winning in a fight.

CONSIDER is not accurate for higher level mobs, since it requires a group
of people working together to slay more powerful beasts.

For example, a level 8 player who considers a level 8 mob to find it's the
same level has a good chance of winning.  A level 50 player who considers a
level 50 to find it's the same level has little chance of winning the fight
alone.
~

0 CONSTITUTION~
Attribute

Constitution represents your health and well-being, how fit you are and how
much pain you gain resist.  Constitution is important for all classes, since
it affects how many hit points you gain per level.  

Some stouter races, such as ogres and centaurs, have much higher levels of
constitution than frailer races such as drow elves or grey elves.

~

0 DAMAGE~
When a character attacks another player or a mob, the amount of damage an
attack does can vary.  The amount of damage done isn't given as an exact
amount, but the verb used in the damage message can give you a good idea
of how much damage was done.

For example, a slash that was described as "devastating" would do more
damage than one that "scratches".
~

0 DEATH CORPSE DYING~
When you die, you re-enter the game at either your birthplace (where you
started the game) or if you are a member of a guild, you can choose to
respawn at a room inside your guildhall.

You can retrieve your corpse by traveling to where you died and getting the
items from inside, assuming someone else hasn't taken your stuff.

Each time you die, you lose a percentage of the experience points you have
gained.  You can lose levels from dying if you lose enough experience to
take you below the requirement for your current level.  However, if you die
and get resurrected (via the spell), you will gain back most of the
experience you lost because of the death.

Corpses will decay over time.  If a corpse decays, the items contained
within will be left in the room.

See also: RESURRECT, EXPERIENCE
~

56 DENY~
Syntax: deny <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within the
game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal a
DENY by editing the appropriate player file.
~

0 DESCRIPTION~
Syntax: description <string>
Syntax: description + <string>

Sets your long description to the given string.  If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions.
~

0 DEXTERITY~
Attribute

Dexterity is a measure of deftness and coordination.  It is the primary
attribute of rogues, and is beneficial to other classes as well.

Some races are naturally more dextrous than others.  Halflings are renown
for their dexterity, while ogres are ridiculed for their lack of it.

Dexterity is also a spell.
Spell
     Enchanter [3rd Circle]
     Sorcerer [3rd Circle]

Area of Effect: <target>
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     Yes
Duration:       Dependant on proficiency of the caster
Type of Spell:  Enchantment

This spell will cause the target's dexterity to increase slightly for a
short period of time.

0 DOORBASH DOORKICK~
Innate ability
     Ogre
     Centaur
     Troll

Syntax: doorbash <direction>
Syntax: doorkick <direction>

Aggressive: No

This ability lets you try and use your weight to break a door.  If you are
using doorbash, you will attempt to charge into the room after you bash it
down, which could be dangerous if something awaits you on the other side.

Kicking the door down is safer, and doesn't cause you to enter the room on
the other side.

Some doors are unbashable.

~

0 DRINK EAT FILL~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat <object>
Syntax: fill <object1> <object2>

When you are thirsty, DRINK will drink from either an object in your
inventory or in the room you are in.

When you are hungry, EAT will eat something from your inventory.

FILL will fill one object with the liquid inside a second object.
Usually the first object is in your inventory, while the second is
located in the room, such as a fountain or spring.

If you get hungry or thirsty, you will be unable to rest and memorize 
or pray for spells.  You also will not regenerate hit points, movement,
or mana while hungry and/or thirsty.  Eventually, you will start losing
hit points due to starvation or thirst.
~

0 DUAL WIELD~
Fighter skill

Only classes that fall under the classification of fighter can wield two
weapons at once.  Dual wielding weapons can help increase the amount of
damage a player can inflict.  The skill increases with levels and with the
use of two weapons in battle.

~

0 FRAG~

A frag is a point given to a player when they kill another player who is above
level 20.  If a player is above level 20 and is killed by another player they
receive a -1 Frag.  

See Also:  FRAGLIST, PKILL
~

0 FRAGLIST~

Syntax:  Frag

The fraglist is the list of the top fraggers on Basternae.  By typing "frag"
the fraglist will come up and list several different categories of fraggers.

See Also:  FRAG, PKILL
~

0 DROP~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> <coin type>
Syntax: drop all

DROP will drop an item or a number of coins.  DROP ALL will drop all
items current in your inventory, but will not drop coins or equipped items.

DROP, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 2 swords and wanted to drop the second one, you
would type:

     drop 2.sword

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the
name.  If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you
would attempt to drop an item with the keyword "2".

on hands, on finger (x2), on wrist (x2), on legs, on feet, attached to
belt (x3), held/wielded/used as shield (x2).

*Centaurs have a unique body shape and may wear certain equipment on the tail
and on the horses body. As these items are specifically made for Centaurs,
other race will not be able to wear them.*

Items can only be worn in certain slots.

Some weapons are two-handed, and require both two hands to wield for most
races (although some strong beings can carry two-handed weapons in one hand).

0 EXPERIENCE XP LEVELS EXP~
Experience points, or EXP, indicate how skillful and experienced you have
become.  You gain power by gaining levels.  Each level will give you
additional health points, and sometimes additional skills, spells, and
abilities.

You gain experience by doing the following:
     Killing a player (from the opposite side of the racewars) or a monster,
       or being in a group that kills a player or monster.
     Directly damaging a player or monster with an attack or spell.
     Healing a "tank" in your group.

You will gain additional experience for killing something that is a higher
level than yourself.  Killing things that are lower in level will result
in less experience.  Killing things while in a group will reduce the amount
of experience you gain, because it is split between group members (with higher
level characters receiving a larger share of the experience, to partially
prevent "power-leveling".

You will lose experience when you die.

player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 2 swords in a backpack and wanted to get the second
one, you would type:

     get 2.sword backpack

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would

0 LUCK~
Attribute

Luck is difficult to describe.  Some people are just born lucky.  It may be
caused by some cosmic karmic balance, or the gods taking a special interest

strange effects on the game, but it isn't a prime attribute for any class.
Needless to say, however, all classes can benefit from high luck scores.

actions.  If the pet attacks, the mob will most likely come after the owner
of the pet if the pet is killed.  Towns with justice systems may arrest pet
owners if the pet breaks any laws.

Pets are commanded using the ORDER command.

Some pets gradually tire of taking orders and cease to follow their masters.

you would type:

-1 STORY~
The story of the world of Basternae is a simple one, but that makes it no
less tragic.

The world is shattered, effectively split in two between the surface world
and that of the Underdark, a massive collections of caves and tunnels that
runs underground.  On the surface, the "good" aligned races make their homes,
while the "evil" races either choose or are forced to live in the dangerous
Underdark.

For all of recorded history, the good and evil races have been at war.
Armies march forward to combat, one side wins and slays the other, then is
destroyed itself by another army.  It is a vicious cycle of warfare and
neither side seems inclined to put a stop to it.  The "good" races talk of
peace, but it's a peace that would cost the lives of all unclean or unpure
races of the dark.  The evil races know only war, trained from birth to live
in hostile environments.  Horrible creatures make their homes in the
Underdark, more than willing to kill any victims for food or sport, but it's
just as likely a young evil will find himself dead from the knife of one of
his kin.

It's the world of Basternae, where reflexes and fighting skills are
constantly honed to perfection, where adventure waits around every corner,
and death can lurk behind even the most friendly of faces.  It's a world of
combat and destruction, where fame and forture go to the aggressive and the
meek get stomped into the ground.

Welcome home.  Welcome to Basternae.

Trip is a skill used by thieves and assassins to gain an unfair advantage
over their opponents.  Trip takes the opponent off their feet where they
will take an extra amount of damage.  A failed trip will put the aggressor
on their back where they will take the damage.

Size does matter!  One may trip a level larger and also an opponent of the
same size, but trip will not work on a smaller opponent.

56 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

56 USERS~
Syntax: users

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are
the channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are
listed in merc.h: 
  0 is CON_PLAYING
  non-zero values are various states of logging in.
~

0 VALUE~
Syntax: value <object> [shopkeeper]

VALUE will let you know how much a shopkeeper is willing to pay for an item
you have.  If no shopkeeper is given, the first shopkeeper in the room will
be chosen.

VALUE, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if the command "LIST DAGGER" showed you that a shopkeeper had
five daggers, you could type "BUY 3.DAGGER".

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would
attempt to buy three daggers, not the third dagger.

Prices in shops can be affected by a player's charisma.

~

0 VISIBILITY~
Syntax: visibility [0]

VISIBILITY without any arguments will inform you of your current visibility
status.  It will let you know if you are invisible or not.

Any other argument to the visibility command will snap you out of

~

0 WAIT 'WAIT STATES'~
Wait states is a mechanism in which we count the delay between your actions.
Commands such like casting, kicking, walking, disarming, brandishing, zapping,
quaffing, etc cause a certain delay before your next action can go through.
This represents the amount of time you need in order to complete the action.

You may also accumulate a delay when a certain action is performed upon you.
These actions are being tripped, disarmed, etc.

If you are in combat, it is wise to use your wait state level as an indicator
as to when your next command will go through.  Should you have a wait state
greater than 0, all your other typed commands will be queued until your wait
returns to 0.

See: PROMPT
~

0 WAKE~
Syntax: wake [target]

WAKE with no target will attempt to awaken yourself if you fell asleep.
WAKE followed by a target name will attempt to awaken that person.

WHO can be used with arguments to provide a filtered list of players of a
certain class, level range, or combination.
~
0 WHIRLWIND~
Applied skill:
     Warrior [Level 1]
Aggressive:  YES

Whirlwind is used by the warriors to visciously attack all those who oppose
them in the room.  They firmly hold their weapon and start spinning around
attacking every mob or player not in the players group.  Whirlwind is 
essentially a hitall.

NOTE:  Whirlwind will make any mob in the room attack you.  Be wary where
you use it!

~

56 WHOIS~
Syntax: whois <character>

WHOIS gives you WHO information on a specific character.  If you request
is vague, it will match your text to anyone with that string in their names.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy [number]

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy and will flee during combat if they are hurt.
~

0 WISDOM~
Attribute

Wisdom is a measure of many things: judgement, enlightenment, willpower,
and intuition.  It represents the planning ability of a character and his
ability to learn from experience.  It is the primary attribute of all
priestly classes and is a benefit to all other classes as well, since it
impacts the speed at which one can learn.

Some races naturally are more wise than others.  The mountain dwarves and
their duergar enemies are counted as some of the wisests of the races,
because of their long lifespan and the methods by which they hand down
information from generation to generation.  Ogres and barbarians are
considered to be the most unwise.

-1 HUMAN~

The human race is younger than most of the other races of good alignment,
but already they have become one of the most powerful and numerous.  Humans
have been blessed (or cursed) with an amazing curiousity and desire to
expand and conquer.  Humans are very adept at living in a wide range of 
conditions and can be found almost anywhere.

Humans are more tolerant of other races and more open-minded about their
views of the world.  They're also one of the more warlike of the good
aligned races and conflicts between humans and elves, dwarves, and
other humans are common.  Because of this, some of the older races view
the humans as untrustworthy and hot-headed.

Class list:  Warrior, ranger, paladin, cleric, druid, sorcerer,
             Elementalist (any focus), Enchanter, Rogue, Mercenary,
             Illusionist, Bard

Stats: Humans are the baseline against which all other races are compared.
As a result, they have no strengths or weaknesses.

-1 DROW 'DROW ELF' DROW ELVES'~

Drow elves, sometimes called dark elves (but never by the drow or anyone
within earshot that wishes to avoid a fight), are an offshoot of the
elven race, kin to the grey elves of the surface.  Because of their evil
nature, the drow were driven out from the homes on the surface and
forced to move into hiding in the bowels of the Underdark.

The drow hate all creatures of the surface and constantly scheme and plot
to slay those who dwell in the sunlight.  Life for a drow in their dark,
gloomy underground cities is hard.  Noble houses and merchant families
strive for power, obtaining it via any possibly means including
assassination, political backstabbing, and open warfare.

Class list:  Warrior, Cleric, Sorcerer, Enchanter, Rogue, Scout
             Bard, Elementalist

Stats:  Drow tend to be weaker and frailer than humans, but are better
        in most other areas. Drow are somewhat resistant to magical
        attacks.

-1 BARBARIAN BARBARIANS~

Barbarians are closely related to humans, but are larger, sturdier,
and possess more stamina than their human cousins.  Many barbarians
are roving nomads, content to roam the plains of the north.  Others
have settled into more permanent towns and cities, forming a society
based on Clans.  

Most barbarians are ill-tempered.  Humans tend think of the barbarians as
stupid and dull, but this is certainly not the case for all barbarians.
Many are outstanding artisans, while others are extremely cunning warriors.

Class list:  Warrior, Mercenary, Shaman

Stats:  Barbarains are generally stronger and hardier than humans,
        but tend to trail them in all other areas.

        STR: Excellent          INT: Bad

-1 DUERGAR 'DUERGAR DWARF'~

Duergar, or gray dwarves, are an evil and twisted race, living in the lowest
depths of the Underdark.  Cunning and manipulative, it is said that only the
duergar can match the cruelty and depravity of the drow elves.  They
hate all other races, but have some grudging relations with a few of the
other races of the Underdark.

Duergar, like the mountain dwarves they despise, are inordinately sturdy and
strong.  They have medium to dark gray skin and hair and prefer to wear
drab clothing to blend into their environment.  Duergar have the unique
ability to cloak themselves in darkness, melding into the shadows to
become invisible.  This ability is only usable in the caverns of the
Underdark

Class list:  Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Mercenary

Stats:  Duergar are stronger and hardier than humans, and somewhat
        more dextrous, but tend to be less intelligent and agile.

        STR: Very Good          INT: Bad

-1 'GREY ELF' 'GREY ELVES'~

Unlike their cousins the drow, grey elves live on the surface and
prefer to dwell in forests.  They are exceptionally intelligent and
swift, but are inclined to be weaker and smaller than humans.  Grey
elves have a good-natured disposition and tend to love animals and
nature, although they loathe drow.  They are born with infravision,
but, unlike drow, can see perfectly in daylight.

Class list:  Ranger, Cleric, Enchanter, Elementalist, Druid, Sorcerer,
            Rogue, Bard

Stats:  Elves tend to be weaker and frailer than Humans, but are 
also quicker and more intelligent.

-1 OGRE~

Ogres are massive, ugly humanoids, standing nine to ten feet in height
and weighing between 300 to 400 pounds.  Ill-tempered and nasty, ogres
are feared by most other races because of their incredible strength
and warlike nature.

Ogres normally live in tribes, ruled by the strongest.  They constantly
fight one another and can not be trusted to keep their word.  Some
ogres focus on the arts of shamanism, but most prefer to pursue the simpler
life of a warrior.

Class list: Warrior, Shaman, Mercenary

Stats: Ogres have a reputation for stupidity and sluggish behavior.
       The raw strength and constitution of these creatures make
       them powerful predators.

        STR: Unsurpassed                INT: Very Poor

-1 DWARF 'MOUNTAIN DWARF'~

Mountain dwarves are a noble race with a history stretching back through the
ages.  Living in great fortresses of stone and rock, the mountain dwarves
are miners by nature, delving deep into the mighty mountain ranges to
carve out their homes.

Dwarves are a close-knit society, preferring the company of their own kind
to that of outsiders.  Mountain dwarves are quite strong, sturdy, and
stubborn to a fault.  They can live to be hundreds of years old and it is
said that each year they live this hard and unyielding nature increases.

Class list: Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Mercenary, Berserker

Stats: Dwarves are stronger and hardier than humans, and somewhat more
       dextrous.  They are, however, less agile and intelligent.

        STR: Very Good                  INT: Bad

-1 TROLL~

Trolls are an ugly race, tall and wiry and possessing enormous strength.
They vary in coloration from pale greens to dark browns and blacks, and
stand much taller than a human.

Trolls are known as being greedy and vicious, living together in warbands in
a clannish society where the only the strong survive.

Trolls have the ability to regenerate damage at an incredible rate, and
possess ultravision.

Class list: Warrior, Mercenary, Shaman

Stats:  Quite strong and durable, trolls are cursed with stupidity and lack
        of wisdom.  They're very quick for their size, which has surprised
        more than one of their victims.

        STR: Excellent                  INT: Very Poor

~

-1 HALFLING~

Halflings are a small humanoid race, blessed with amazing quickness and
dexterity but hampered by their lack of size.  Jovial and carefree by nature,
halflings stand roughly half the size of a human (hence the name), and
usually possess curly brown or dark hair, a light tan complexion, and a
stout or heavy frame caused by the halfling tendancy to indulge in good
food and spirits.

Halflings make excellent thieves because of their impressive quickness, but
this has caused many people to shun or outcast the entire race.  "All
halflings are thieves, it's just some do it more often" is a popular saying.

Class list: Warrior, Cleric, Sorcerer, Thief

Stats:  Nimble and quick, halflings are quick on their feet and just as fast
        with their hands.  Weaker than humans, they aren't overly intelligent
        or wise either.

        STR: Below Average              INT: Below Average

-1 ORC~

Orcs are a race of evil humanoids, some say a twisted mockery of the human
race.  They typically stand five to six feet tall and have pale yellow, brown,
or greenish skin and red eyes.  Orcs are the most social of the evil races,
and are known to build huge warbands that invade and pillage the lands of the
good races until they are destroyed.

Orcs have roughly the same attributes as humans as well, further hinting at
some link between the two species, although what that link may be has been
lost in time.

Class list: Warrior, Shaman, Cleric, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Mercenary, Thief,
            Assassin, Anti-paladin, Illusionist

Stats:  Orcs are almost mirror images of humans, possessing a little more 
        strength and constitution, but a little less intelligence and wisdom.

-1 GNOME~

Gnomes are small humanoids, similar in stature to halflings, but more related
to the dwarven races than halflings.  Gnomes are intelligent and curious, and
have a fascination with all things mechanical and magical.  Gnomes are also
known to be a sturdy and dependable race.

Class list: Warrior, Cleric, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Illusionist

Stats:  Gnomes have quick minds and above normal wisdom, and a quick and 
        dextrous body to match.  They lack strength, but are surprisingly 
        durable for their size.

-1 MINOTAUR~
Coming soon!

~

-1 HALF-ELF 'HALF ELF'~

Half-elves are a combination of human and elven parents, and this mixed
breeding usually causes them to be shunned by both sides.  Usually humans
and elves cannot have children, but in a few cases a normal birth occurs,
often at the cost of the mother's life.  This sad way to enter the world
is just the start of what is usually a tough and unfair life for a half-elf.

Half-elves usually come in two types: those who try to fit in with "normal"
society, and those with a chip on their shoulders who dare anyone to look down
upon them because of their heritage.

Half-elves have a mixture of human and elven physical traits, being somewhat
stronger and healthier than grey elves, but less so than a human.

Class list: Warrior, Ranger, Druid, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Bard

Stats:  Half-elves tend to be slightly weaker and frailer than humans, but
        are quicker and smarter than their related kin.

-1 GOBLIN~

Goblins are a race of evil humanoids that are, typically, three to four
feet tall with green or yellowish skin and red eyes.  Goblins are usually
looked down upon by many of the other evil races because of their small
stature, despite the fact that goblin shamans are dangerous casters.

In the world of the Underdark, where surviving from day to day is difficult,
goblins are survivors.  Despite their small size, goblins can adapt to
their environments very easy and learn to fit in.  If more powerful races
threaten to overwhelm a goblin village, they either flee to live another day
or learn to make themselves invaluable to their conquerers.  Either way, the
main goal of a goblin is to live to see another day.

Class list: Warrior, Shaman, Cleric, Thief

Stats:  Goblins tend to be weaker than most other races, but have a strange
        kind of wisdom that comes from being survivors.  Goblins are quick
        enough to roll with a punch, and fast enough to stick a dagger in
        the person doing the punching.

-1 CENTAUR~

Centaurs are a race with human torsos atop the bodies of horses.  Because
of their odd body shapes, they cannot wear some of the equipment that normal
humanoid-shaped races can.  Their strength, however, makes them ideal
warriors, and they can wield much larger weapons than any of the other
surface races.  They prefer to dwell in natural surroudings, shunning the
major cities, and this link with nature has led them to develop a small
talent for druidic practices.  Their somewhat slow-wittedness, however,
makes them somewhat less wise than the rest of the surface world.

Some people shun or hunt centaurs because of their odd physical shape.
Many times centaurs are outcast from the larger cities when they do visit.
This has caused the centaur peoples to become very tribal and close-knit.

Class list: Warrior, druid

Stats:  Centaurs are large and very strong.  They lack the keen mental powers
        of some of the other surface races and they tend to be a little bit
        clumsy because of their bulk.

        STR: Unsurpassed                INT: Very Poor

-1 RAKSHASA~

Rakshasas are a race of evil spirits encased in flesh.  Standing between
six and seven feet tall, they appear as humanoid creatures with the bodily
features of animals, usually tigers and apes.  Rakshasa are enemies of
humanity, waging a constant war for reasons unknown to any but the Rakshasa.

Magical in nature, rakshasas make excellent spellcasters and have an innate
resistance to magical attacks.  They are honorable creatures but also tend
to be manipulative and deceptive, twisting arguments to suit their purposes.

Class list: Warrior, Conjurer, Sorcerer, Shaman, Thief, Assassin, 
            Illusionist, Bard

-1 FLIND~

Flind are evil, dog-faced humanoids, able to stand erect on two legs and with
hands able to manipulate as well as any human.  Smarter than gnolls, who are
similar in appearance to the flind, they are short, dirty, and usually
covered in red or brown fur.

The flind are a pack society, preferring to live in isolated flind
communities.  The head of the pack is usually the strongest warrior in the
community and serves until another defeats him in ritual combat.  Flind are
vicious and bloodthirsty, and flind raiding parties are common sights in many
of the more remote locations of civilization.  Flind prefer to attack those
weaker than themselves, and have a tendancy to flee from fair fights.

Class list: Warrior, Mercenary, Shaman, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Thief

Stats:  Flind are more muscular and more intelligent than their gnoll
        cousins, which puts them about on an even level with humans.  Flinds
        make good spellcasters because of their intelligence, but the most
        flind choose to be more aggressive warrior classes.

-1 RANGER~
Fighter sub-class

Rangers are fighters who are trained in outdoor survival and combat.  Rangers

survive in the wilderness.  They have a link with nature, and are at their best
when fighting in a natural environment.

Rangers have limited spellcasting abilities, which increases as they gain in
level and learn to harness the raw forces of the magic of nature.  

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Intelligence

-1 PALADIN~
Fighter sub-class

Paladins are holy warriors, people who fight for their gods and attempt to
bring good to the world.  Paladins are given some limited spellcasting
abilities by their gods, but only as long as they strive to destroy what is
evil and vile in the world.  Paladins are experts with two-handed weapons,
gaining bonuses to hit as they go up in level.  In addition, paladins have
a much higher chance of successfully bashing an opponent without using a shield.

Paladins can detect evil and have the ability to summon a mount when the need
arises.  Paladins can also layhands, channelling the healing power of their
god onto themselves or another person.

Paladins cannot group with anti-paladins, and most likely would attack such an
evil creature on sight.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Wisdom
Races: Human

Equipment: Paladins can use almost all weapons and armor.  They are limited
           in the types of magical items such as wands, staves, or scrolls.

Innate Abilities: Layhands, Detect Evil, Summon Mount (at level 10),
                  Protection from Evil

Paladins, because of their religious nature, may NOT toggle vicious to on.
They cannot toggle AGGR on either.  Paladins can also LOSE experience from
attacking good-aligned creatures.  The following chart gives you an idea of
how experience is calculated for paladins:

Victim is evil or neutral with alignment less than 0:
     Full experience as normal
Victim is neutral with alignment equal to or more than zero and aggressive:
     Gain 1/5th normal experience
Victim is neutral with alignment equal to or more than zero and not
aggressive:
     Lose 1/5th normal experience
Victim is good and aggressive:
     Gain 1/50th normal experience
Victim is good and non-aggressive:
     Lose experience equal to the normal amount

-1 'ANTI-PALADIN' ANTI 'ANTI PALADIN'~
Fighter sub-class

Anti-paladins are the anti-thesis of paladins.  They serve the evil gods and
seek to bring nothing but pain and suffering to the world.  Some are
paladins who have fallen from grace or been turned in their faith by dark
gods.  Others are from the evil races.

Anti-paladins, like paladins, get limited spellcasting abilities granted by
their gods.  These abilities increase as their level increases, showing the
anti-paladin to be gaining favor with his chosen diety.  

Anti-paladins have the innate ability to detect good, and have some limited
protection from good.  Anti-paladins are superb fighters when wielding
two-handed weapons and have trained so that they can bash effectively when
not using a shield.  Anti-paladins are granted the powers of 'vampiric touch',
their dark gods healing them as they do damage to others.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Wisdom
Races: Orc, Human

Equipment: Anti-Paladins can use almost all weapons and armor.  They are
           limited in the types of magical items such as wands, staves, or
           scrolls.

Innate Abilities: Detect Good, Summon Mount (must be level 10), Protection from 
                  Good, Vampiric Touch

-1 THIEF~
Rogue sub-class

Thieves are rogues, stealing and killing to make a living.  They're the
masters of picking locks, finding traps, and stealing from friend and foe
alike.  Thieves prefer to skulk in the shadows during combat, waiting for
the opportunity to stab someone in the back.  They have some abilities that
allow them to fight head-to-head, but against a properly trained and
equipped warrior, they probably don't stand a chance.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility
Races: 

Equipment: Thieves are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes sneaking in
           shadows impossible.

Innate Abilities: None

Rogue sub-class

Assassins are trained killers, men and women who cloak themselves in dark and
shadows in order to slay their chosen victims.  Assassins are the masters of
the "instant kill", surprising a foe and murdering it in a single strike.
Assassins are experts in the arts of backstabbing, placing a dagger or two
right in the vital areas of a target and causing horrendous damage.  Most
assassins work alone, although some work in teams in order to bring down
difficult opponents.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility
Races: 

Equipment: Assassins are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of 
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes sneaking
           in shadows impossible.

-1 CLERIC~
Priest sub-class

Clerics are men and women who gain magical powers granted by their gods.
Their deities give them great abilities which they use to further the goals
of their chosen gods and goddesses.

The deity a cleric worships is chosen by his or her race, and sometimes by
the clerics sex as well (in the case of the drow deities).  Each god or
goddess grants their follows with some unique spells and abilities.

Falling out of favor with one's god (usually because of a cleric's alignment
changing) can be very nasty.  Gods do not enjoy priests who turn away from
their religion.

Important Attributes: Wisdom
Races: 

Equipment: Clerics are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged weapons 
           such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear most types of 
           armor.

-1 DRUID~
Priest sub-class

Druids are priests who gain their powers from nature itself.  They usually
live in the woods and forests and live to protect the trees and wildlife
contained within.  Attempting to harm a druid's forest in any way will bring
the priest's wrath.  Druids gain spells from the deities of the forests and
nature, and have some incredible powers at their disposal.  Many of these
spells must be cast in the outdoors, while others are just less effective
while inside.

Important Attributes: Wisdom
Races: 

Equipment: Druids are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged weapons 
           such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear most types of 
           armor.

-1 SHAMAN~
Priest sub-class

Shamans wield the forces of nature, the elements, and the spirit world, using
totems to focus their powers into terrific magical effects.  Unlike druids,
who also gain powers from nature, shamans do not worship any deities.  They
harness and twist the forces of nature into doing their bidding, rather than
asking politely as would a druid.

Shamans must use totems to cast spells.

Important Attributes: Wisdom
Races: 

Equipment: Shaman are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged weapons
           such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear most types of 
           armor.

-1 SORCERER~
Magic-User sub-class

Sorcerers are spellcasters who have focused their lives on gaining power
from the magical forces that surround them.  They wield incredible offensive
power with their magic, but their physical abilities are lacking.  Sorcerers,
like all magic-users, must rely on spellbooks to contain their accumulated
knowledge.  The spellbook is used when memorizing the spell, but once it has
been cast, the knowledge of its casting disappears from the sorcerer's memory.

Important Attributes: Intelligence
Races: 

Equipment: Sorcerers are spellcasters and are very limited in their use of 
           weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.

Innate Abilities: None

-1 ELEMENTALIST~
Magic-User sub-class

Elementalists focus on one of the major elements (air, fire, water, earth)
and learn to harness the power of that element for use in spellcasting.
Elementalists can conjure up beings of their chosen element, called
elementals, and have them serve as pets for short periods of time.  They
also gain other powerful spells from their studies, and the effects of those
spells vary wildly from one element to another.

As stated above, there are four types of elementalists.  The evil races are
more akin to the destructive powers of fire and air.  The good races are more
akin to the powers of earth and water.  Each element has an opposite (air and
earth, fire and water) and there are spells that are based on this opposition.

Like sorcerers, elementalists must have spellbooks to memorize their spells.
Without the knowledge contained within those tomes, the elementalist cannot
wield his power.

Important Attributes: Intelligence
Races: 

Equipment: Elementalists are spellcasters and are very limited in their use
           of weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.

Innate Abilities: None

-1 BARD~
Rogue sub-class

Bard are a unique clss, mixing a blend of rogue skills with magical
abilities granted by their music.  Bards are traveling entertainers,
telling tales and singing songs of lore and heroism.

Bards use instruments and song to create magical effects.  The power
of their music may not be as powerful as a mage's magic, but many of
the bard's "spells" are unique to his class and very beneficial to the
bard's entire party.  Bards are truly suited for large groups.

Not even the greatest of bards can sing indefinitely, however, and
when the throat of a bard gets sore, he must rest to regain his strength.
This is represented by a bard's "mana", which regenerates over time.
Each song a bard plays takes a certain amount of mana.  Certain songs can
be continuously sung, draining mana over a period of time.

Important Attributes: Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution
Races: 

Equipment: 

Equipment: Bards are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes playing
           instruments difficult.

Innate Abilities: None

-1 'BARD SONGS' SONGS~
Bards use the 'play' command to cast spells.  The syntax of the play
command is 'play songname', where the songname does not include the
words 'Song of'.

      play invisibility

-1 MERCENARY~
Fighter sub-class

The mercenary is a blend of fighter and rogue, having some of the skills of
each.  While he can't match the warrior in fighting skills nor the assassin
in backstabbing abilities, the skills that the mercenary possess combine
some of the best from both worlds.

Mercenaries are soldiers for hire, bounty hunters, pirates, and smugglers.
They have the unique ability to try and capture a foe, and at high levels of
experience they learn how to crush the throat of a spellcaster.  Mercenaries
also have the headbutt skill, which they can use and attempt to knock out
or daze an opponent.

Important Attributes: Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Constitution
Races: 

Equipment: Mercenaries are a fighter-rogue hybrid.  They can use most weapons.
           Their choice of armor is extensive, but still somewhat limited when 
           compared to a warrior.

Innate Abilities: None

-1 PSIONICIST~

Psionicists are a class that has amazing control over their minds, allowing
them to master the hidden power of the mind itself.  Psionicists use this
internal power to advance their causes, whatever those may be.  Psionicists
use the 'will' command to focus their energies, much like a magic-user does
while casting.

Psionicists don't require a spellbook, however.  When they gain levels, they
automatically gain the power and ability to cast new spells.

Psionicists use mana to cast spells.  They can continue to cast spells until
their reserve of mana is exhausted.  At that point, they must rest and
regenerate mana before they can cast spells again.

Important Attributes: Intelligence, Wisdom
Races: 

Equipment: Psionicists are spellcasters and are very limited in their use
           of weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.
