Generic Vnums for Objects in Basternae 2 (version 2).
-----------------------------------------------------

There's no reason to reinvent the iron ration.  You can use the following vnums to add
generic items to your zone.  More may be added later.  They'll show up as "object not
in this zone file" in the editor, but the MUD will recognize them.

This by no means should prevent you from creating a similar item or an item with the
same name, it just gives you an option to reuse generic items so you don't have to
reinvent them.

Just a note, if you want to use the generic vnums, you'll have to start your zone at a
vnum of 1000 or greater or when it is renumbered the generic vnums will be hosed.  This
is easy for any zones already in progress, since you can just use the command "renum 1000"
and the zone will be renumbered starting at 1000.  The reason I say 1000 is because that
is the number of vnums reserved for generic objects on the MUD.
